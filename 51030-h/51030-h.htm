<p>'In these volumes there is nothing tedious, and they are well put together.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard.</span></p>

<p>'Mr. Fitzpatrick, who has done more than any living writer for Irish biography,
has in this, his latest and most important work earned the gratitude of all students
of Irish politics.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily Telegraph.</span></p>

<p>'This work stands high above the extravagant and indiscriminating eulogies of
O'Connell, accompanied by ignorant and malignant denunciations of all opposed to
him, hitherto given to the world by patriotic biographers.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Times.</span></p>

<p>'Inspired by love and admiration, pursued with laborious and indefatigable
industry, and guided by honesty and good judgment. It gives a higher and, we
believe, a truer view of O'Connell's character than has been given to the world
before.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vanity Fair.</span></p>

<p>'Fresh light is thrown upon a most interesting period of Irish history by this
publication, in which Daniel O'Connell reveals his innermost thoughts upon great
public questions, as well as on themes of sacred and private import. Courts and
Cabinets&mdash;the intrigues of public men and the subtleties of political organisations&mdash;are
alike laid open to the public gaze.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily Chronicle.</span></p>

<p>'To Mr. Fitzpatrick is due the gratitude of all students of history, of truth, and
of human character for the patience and pertinacity with which he has collected
these letters, and the knowledge, discretion, and tact of his arrangement. He has
let O'Connell tell his own story, and the connecting thread is slight and scientific,
such as only minute knowledge of his period could make it. The reader is hardly
conscious of its presence, yet it suffices to weld a huge mass of miscellaneous correspondence
into an authentic biography and lifelike portrait of the man who, of all
others, made the greatest mark on his country and his generation.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Athen√¶um.</span></p>

<p>'Mr. Fitzpatrick, while presenting to us a collection of moderate extent, has not
only woven them into a web of fair average continuity, but has, as a sculptor
would, presented to us his hero "in the round," so that we may consider each of his
qualities in each varied light, and judge of their combination into a whole, whether
it is mean or noble, consistent or inconsistent, natural or forced.... Few
indeed, as I think, of those who give a careful perusal to these pages, will withhold
their assent from the double assertion that O'Connell was a great man, and that he
was a good man. Upon this issue the volumes now before us will enable us to try
him: and in trying him to try ourselves. For who can any longer doubt that some
debt is still due to him; that he was, to say the least, both over-censured and undervalued?'&mdash;Mr.

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>These rough notes&mdash;begun long ago and continued at slow
intervals&mdash;were put aside during the onerous task of editing
for Mr. Murray the O'Connell Correspondence. The recent
publication of Mr. Lecky's final volumes, awakening by their
grasp a fixed interest in pre-Union times, and confirming much
that by circumstantial evidence I had sought to establish,
affords a reason, perhaps, that my later researches in the same
field ought not to be wholly lost. Mr. Lecky's kindness in frequently
quoting me<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> merits grateful acknowledgment, not less
than his recognition of some things that I brought to light as
explanatory of points to which the State Papers afford no clue.
This and other circumstances encourage me in offering more.</p>

<p>My sole purpose at the outset was to expose a well-cloaked
case of long-continued betrayal by one of whom Mr. Froude
confesses that all efforts to identify had failed;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but afterwards
it seemed desirable to disclose to the reader a wider knowledge
of an exciting time.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In various instances a veil will be found
lifted, or a visor unlocked, revealing features which may prove
a surprise. Nor is the story without a moral. The organisers
of illegal societies will see that, in spite of the apparent secrecy
and ingenuity of their system, informers sit with them at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>same council-board and dinner-table, ready at any moment to
sell their blood; and that the wider the ramifications of conspiracy,
the greater becomes the certainty of detection.</p>

<p>It may be that some of these researches are more likely
to interest and assist students of the history of the time than
to prove pleasant reading for those who take up a book merely
for enjoyment. Yet if there is truth in the axiom that men
who write with ease are read with difficulty, and <i lang="la">vice vers√¢</i>,
these chapters ought to find readers. Every page had its
hard work. Tantalising delays attended at times the search
for some missing&mdash;but finally discovered&mdash;link. Indeed,
volumes of popular reading, written <i lang="la">currente calamo</i>, might
have been thrown off for a tithe of the trouble.</p>

<p>'If the power to do hard work is not talent,' writes Garfield,
'it is the best possible substitute for it. Things don't
turn up in this world until somebody turns them up.' Readers
who, thanks to Froude and Lecky, have been interested by
glimpses of men in startling attitudes, would naturally like to
learn the curious sequel of their subsequent history. This I
have done my best to furnish. The present volume is humbly
offered as a companion to the two great works just alluded
to. But it will also prove useful to readers of the Wellington,
Castlereagh, Cornwallis, and Colchester Correspondence.
These books abound in passages which, without explanation,
are unintelligible. The matter now presented forms but a
small part of the notes I have made with the same end.</p>

<p>A word as regards some of the later sources of my information.
The Pelham MSS. were not accessible when Mr.
Froude wrote. Thomas Pelham, second Earl of Chichester,
was Irish Secretary from 1795 to 1798, but his correspondence
until 1826 deals largely with Ireland, and I have read as
much of it as would load a float. Another mine was found in
the papers, ranging from 1795 to 1805, which filled two iron-clamped
chests in Dublin Castle, guarded with the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
seal and bearing the words 'Secret and Confidential: Not
to be Opened.' These chests were for a long time familiar
objects exteriorly, and when it was at last permitted to disturb
the rust of lock and hinge, peculiar interest attended the
exploration. Among the contents were 136 letters from
Francis Higgins, substantially supporting all that I had ventured
to say twenty years before in the book which claimed
to portray his career. But neither the Pelham Papers in
London nor the archives at Dublin Castle reveal the great
secret to which Mr. Froude points.</p>

<p>That so many documents have been preserved is fortunate.
Mr. Ross, in his preface to the Cornwallis Correspondence,
laments that 'the Duke of Portland, Lord Chancellor Clare,
Mr. Wickham, Mr. King, Sir H. Taylor, Sir E. Littlehales,
Mr. Marsden, and indeed almost all the persons officially
concerned, appear to have destroyed the whole of their
papers.' He adds: 'The destruction of so many valuable
documents respecting important transactions cannot but be
regarded as a serious loss to the political history of these
times.'</p>

<p>I have freely used the Registry of Deeds Office, Dublin&mdash;a
department peculiar to Ireland. Originating in penal times,
its object was to trace any property acquired by Papists&mdash;such
being liable to 'discovery and forfeiture.' This office served
as a valuable curb in the hands of the oppressor, and ought
to prove a not less useful aid to historic inquirers; but,
hitherto, it has been unconsulted for such purposes. Few
unless legal men can pursue the complicated references and
searches, and&mdash;unlike the Record Office&mdash;fees attend almost
every stage of the inquiry. Here things stranger than fiction
nestle; while the genealogist will find it an inexhaustible
store.</p>

<p>I have to thank the Right Hon. the O'Conor Don, D.L.;
Sir William H. Cope, Bart.; Mrs. John Philpot Curran;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Daniel O'Connell, Esq., D.L.; D. Coffey, Esq.; Jeremiah Leyne,
Esq.; the late Lord Donoughmore, and the late Mr. Justice
Hayes for the communication of manuscripts from the archives
of their respective houses. The Rev. Samuel Haughton,
F.T.C.D., kindly copied for me some memoranda made in
1798 by the Rev. John Barrett, Vice-Provost T.C.D., regarding
students of alleged rebel leanings. Sir Charles Russell,
when member for Dundalk, obligingly made inquiries concerning
Samuel Turner; Mr. Lecky transcribed for me a
curious paper concerning Aherne, the rebel envoy in France,
and has been otherwise kind. My indebtedness to Sir Bernard
Burke, Keeper of the Records, Dublin Castle, dates from the
year 1855.</p>

<p>The late Brother Luke Cullen, a Carmelite monk, left at his
death a vast quantity of papers throwing light on the period
of the Rebellion. No writer but myself has ever had the use
of these papers, and I beg to thank the Superior of the Order
to which Mr. Cullen belonged for having, some years ago,
placed them in my hands.</p>

<p>The array of notes and authorities on every page is not the
best way to please an artistic eye; but in a book of this sort
they are indispensable and would be certainly expected from
the oldest living contributor to 'Notes and Queries.'</p>

<p>While there are many persons who enjoy a fox hunt, there
are others would vote it a bore; and readers of this mind had
better, perhaps, pass over the various stages of my chase
after Samuel Turner, and come to something that may suit
them better.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

A MYSTERIOUS VISITOR</h2>


<p>It is now some years since Mr. Froude invested with new
interest the Romance of Rebellion. Perhaps the most curious
of the episodes disclosed by him is that where, after
describing the plans and organisation of the United Irishmen,
he proceeds to notice a sensational case of betrayal.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An instance has now to be related [he writes] remarkable for the
ingenious perfidy with which it was attended, for the mystery which
still attaches to the principal performer, and for his connection with
the fortunes and fate of Lord Edward Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Lord Edward's movements had for some time been observed
with anxiety, as much from general uneasiness as from regret that
a brother of the Duke of Leinster should be connecting himself
with conspiracy and treason. His proceedings in Paris in 1792 had
cost him his commission in the army. In the Irish Parliament he
had been undistinguished by talent, but conspicuous for the violence
of his language. His meeting with Hoche on the Swiss frontier
was a secret known only to a very few persons; Hoche himself had
not revealed it even to Tone; but Lord Edward was known to be
intimate with McNevin. He had been watched in London, and
had been traced to the lodgings of a suspected agent of the French
Directory; and among other papers which had been forwarded by
spies to the Government, there was one in French, containing an
allusion to some female friend of Lady Edward, through whom a
correspondence was maintained between Ireland and Paris. Lady
Edward's house at Hamburg was notoriously the resort of Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>refugees. Lord Edward himself was frequently there, and the
Government suspected, though they were unable to prove, that he
was seriously committed with the United Irishmen. One night,
early in October, 1797,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a person came to the house of Lord
Downshire in London, and desired to see him immediately. Lord
Downshire went into the hall and found a man muffled in a cloak,
with a hat slouched over his face, who requested a private interview.
The Duke (<em>sic</em>) took him into his Library, and when he threw off
his disguise recognised in his visitor the son of a gentleman of good
fortune in the North of Ireland, with whom he was slightly acquainted.
Lord Downshire's 'friend' (the title under which he was
always subsequently described) had been a member of the Ulster
Revolutionary Committee. From his acquaintance with the details
of what had taken place it may be inferred that he had accompanied
the Northern delegacy to Dublin and had been present at the discussion
of the propriety of an immediate insurrection. The cowardice
or the prudence of the Dublin faction had disgusted him. He
considered now that the conspiracy was likely to fail, or that, if it
succeeded, it would take a form which he disapproved; and he had
come over to sell his services and his information to Pitt. In
telling his story to Lord Downshire he painted his own conduct in
colours least discreditable to himself. Like many of his friends, he
had at first, he said, wished only for a reform in parliament and a
change in the constitution. He had since taken many desperate
steps and connected himself with desperate men. He had discovered
that the object of the Papists was the ruin and destruction of the
country, and the establishment of a tyranny worse than that which
was complained of by the reformers; that proscriptions, seizures of
property, murders, and assassinations were the certain consequences
to be apprehended from their machinations; that he had determined
to separate himself from the conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He was in England to
make every discovery in his power, and if Lord Downshire had
not been in London he had meant to address himself to Portland
or Pitt. He stipulated only, as usual, that he should never be called
on to appear in a court of justice to prosecute any one who might be
taken up in consequence of his discoveries.</p>

<p>Lord Downshire agreed to his conditions; but, as it was then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>late, he desired him to return and complete his story in the morning.
He said that his life was in danger even in London. He could
not venture a second time to Lord Downshire, or run the risk of being
observed by his servants. Downshire appointed the empty residence
of a friend in the neighbourhood. Thither he went the next day in
a hackney coach. The door was left unlocked, and he entered
unseen by anyone. Lord Downshire then took down from his lips
a list of the principal members of the Executive Committee by
whom the whole movement was at that time directed. He next
related at considerable length the proceedings of the United Irishmen
during the two past years, the division of opinion, the narrow
chance by which a rising had been escaped in Dublin in the spring,
and his own subsequent adventures. He had fled with others from
Belfast in the general dispersion of the leaders. Lady Edward
Fitzgerald had given him shelter at Hamburg, and had sent him
on to Paris with a letter to her brother-in-law, General Valence.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> By
General Valence he had been introduced to Hoche and De la
Croix. He had seen Talleyrand, and had talked at length with
him on the condition of Ireland. He had been naturally intimate
with the other Irish refugees. Napper Tandy<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was strolling about
the streets in uniform and calling himself a major. Hamilton
Rowan<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> had been pressed to return, but preferred safety in America,
and professed himself <em>sick of politics</em>. After this, 'the person'&mdash;as
Lord Downshire called his visitor, keeping even the Cabinet in ignorance
of his name&mdash;came to the immediate object of his visit to
England.</p>

<p>He had discovered that all important negotiations between the
Revolutionary Committee in Dublin and their Paris agents passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>through Lady Edward's hands. The Paris letters were transmitted
first to her at Hamburg. By her they were forwarded to Lady
Lucy Fitzgerald<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in London. From London Lady Lucy was able
to send them on unsuspected. Being himself implicitly trusted,
both by Lady Edward and by Lady Lucy, he believed he could
give the Government information which would enable them to
detect and examine these letters in their transit through the
post.</p>

<p>Pitt was out of town. He returned, however, in a few days.
Downshire immediately saw him, and Pitt consented that 'the
person's' services should be accepted. There was some little
delay. 'The person' took alarm, disappeared, and they supposed
that they had lost him. Three weeks later, however, he wrote to
Downshire from Hamburg, saying that he had returned to his old
quarters, for fear he might be falling into a trap. It was fortunate,
he added, that he had done so, for a letter was on the point of
going over from Barclay Teeling<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to Arthur O'Connor,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and he
gave Downshire directions which would enable him to intercept,
read, and send it on.</p>

<p>Such an evidence of 'the person's' power and will to be useful
made Pitt extremely anxious to secure his permanent help. An
arrangement was concluded. He continued at Hamburg as Lady
Edward's guest and most trusted friend, saw everyone who came
to her house, kept watch over her letter-bag, was admitted to close
and secret conversations upon the prospect of French interference
in Ireland with Reinhard, the Minister of the Directory there, and
he regularly kept Lord Downshire informed of everything which
would enable Pitt to watch the conspiracy. One of his letters,
dated November 19, 1797, is preserved:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A. Lowry writes from Paris, August 11, in great despondency
on account of Hoche's death, and says that all hopes of invading
Ireland were given over.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<p>'I then saw Reinhard, the French Minister, who begged me to
stay here, as the only mode in which I could serve my country and
the Republic. I instantly acquiesced, and told him I had arranged
matters with Lord Edward Fitzgerald in London for that purpose.
I showed him Lowry's<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> letter. He said that things were changed.
Buonaparte would not listen to the idea of peace, and had some
plan which I do not know. I told him the spirit of republicanism
was losing ground in Ireland, for the Catholics and Protestants
could not be brought to unite. I mentioned then what Fitzgerald
told me in London, viz., that after I left Ireland they had thoughts
of bringing matters to a crisis without the French. Arthur
O'Connor was to have had a command in the North, he himself in
Leinster, Robert Simms<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> at Belfast; that the Catholics got jealous
of this, and Richard McCormick,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of Dublin, went among the societies
of United Men and denounced the three as traitors to the cause,
and dangerous on account of their ambition. All letters to or
from Lady Lucy Fitzgerald ought to be inspected.</p>

<p>'She, Mrs. Matthieson, of this place, and Pamela<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> carry on a
correspondence. Lewins, Teeling, Tennant, Lowry, Orr, and
Colonel Tandy are at Paris. Tone expects to stay the winter
there, which does not look like invasion. Oliver Bond is
treasurer. He pays Lewins and McNevin in London. Now for
myself. In order to carry into effect the scheme which you and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Mr. Pitt had planned, it was requisite for me to see my countrymen.
I called on Maitland,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> where I found A. J. Stuart,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of Acton,
both of them heartily <em>sick of politics</em>. Edward Fitzgerald had
been inquiring of them for me. I went to Harley Street, where
Fitz told me of the conduct of the Catholics to him and his friends.
He said he would prevail on O'Connor, or some such, to go to
Paris. If not, he would go himself in order to have Lewins
removed. Mrs. Matthieson<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has just heard from Lady Lucy that
O'Connor is to come. I supped last night with Valence, who
mentioned his having introduced Lord Edward and O'Connor to
the Minister here in the summer, before the French attempted to
invade Ireland. They both went to Switzerland, whence O'Connor
passed into France, had an interview with Hoche, and everything
was planned.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>'I feared lest Government might not choose to ratify our contract,
and, being in their power, would give me my choice either
to come forward as an evidence or suffer martyrdom myself.
Having no taste for an exit of this sort, I set out and arrived here
safe, and now beg you'll let me know if anything was wrong in my
statements, or if I have given offence. If you approve my present
mode of life, and encourage me so to do, with all deference I think
Mr. Pitt may let me have a cool five hundred,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which shall last me
for six months to come. To get the information here has cost
me three times the sum, and to keep up the acquaintance and
connections I have here, so as to get information, I cannot live on
less.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The betrayer, before his interview with Downshire closed,
supplied him with a list of the Executive Committee of
United Irishmen. This list, duly given by Mr. Froude,
includes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jackson and his son; Oliver Bond; John Chambers; James
Dickson; Casey, a red-faced Dublin priest; Thomas Addis Emmet;
Dr. McNevin, a physician who had great weight with the papists;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Braughall, John Keogh and R. McCormick, who belonged to the
committee, though they did not attend; Samuel Turner; Lord
Edward Fitzgerald; Arthur O'Connor; Alexander Stewart; two Orrs,
one an attorney and a dangerous person, the other of Derry, described
as a clever, sensible, strong-minded man; B. Teeling;
Tenants, of Belfast; Agnew, of Larne; Lawless, Lord Cloncurry's
son; Hamill, of Dominick Street<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; Inishry,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a priest, a canting,
designing man, who swore in Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Lawless.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p>Lord Downshire, who negotiated in this affair, had weight
with Pitt. The husband of an English peeress, and the son
of Lord North's Secretary of State, he was a familiar figure
at Court. He had sat for two English constituencies;
and in the Irish Parliament as senator, borough proprietor,
governor of his county, and one of the Privy Council, he
wielded potent sway. His later history and fall belong to
chapter ix.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

ARRESTS MULTIPLY</h2>


<p>It was not easy to separate the threads of the tangled skein
which Mr. Froude found hidden away in the dust of the past.
But, lest the process of unravelling should tax the reader's
patience, I have transferred to an Appendix some points of
circumstantial evidence which led me, at first, to suspect, and
finally to feel convinced, that 'the person' was no other than
Samuel Turner, Esq., LL.D., barrister-at-law, of Turner's
Glen, Newry&mdash;one of the shrewdest heads of the Northern
executive of United Irishmen.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Pitt made a good stroke by
encouraging his overtures, but, like an expert angler, ample
line was given ere securing fast the precious prey.</p>

<p>One can trace, through the public journals of the time,
that the betrayer's disclosures to Downshire were followed by
a decided activity on the part of the Irish Government. The
more important of the marked men were suffered to continue
at large, but the names having been noted Lord Camden
was able, at the threatened outburst of the rebellion, to seize
them at once. Meanwhile an influential London paper, the
'Courier' of November 24, 1797, gave a glimpse of the system
that then prevailed by announcing the departure from Dublin
for England of Dr. Atkinson, High Constable of Belfast,
charged, it is said, with full powers from Government to arrest
such persons as have left Ireland, and against whom there are
charges of a treasonable or seditious nature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The former gentleman is well known, and will be long remembered
by the inhabitants of Belfast, for the active part he took in
assisting <em>a Northern Marquis</em>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and the young apostate of the County
Down, to arrest seven of their fellow-citizens on September 16,
1796; since which period these unfortunate men have been closely
confined without being allowed to see their friends, and now remain
without hope of trial or liberation.</p></div>

<p>'The young apostate of Down'&mdash;thus indicated for
English readers ninety years ago&mdash;was Lord Castlereagh,
afterwards Minister for Foreign Affairs, and well twitted by
Byron for his Toryism; but who, in 1790, had been elected,
after a struggle of two months' duration and an outlay of
60,000<em>l.</em>, Whig Member for Down. Like Pitt, he began as a
reformer; like Disraeli, he avowed himself a Radical; and
presided at a banquet where toasts were drunk such as 'Our
Sovereign Lord the People.' Ere long his policy changed,
and his memory is described as having the faint sickening
smell of hot blood about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude's work has been several years before the world;
it has passed through various editions. Thousands of readers
have been interested by his picture of the muffled figure
gliding at dark to breathe in Downshire's ear most startling
disclosures, but no attempt to solve the mystery enshrouding
it has until now been made.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The name of Samuel Turner obtains no place on the list
of Secret Service moneys<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> expended by the Irish Government
in 1798&mdash;thus bearing out the statement of Mr. Froude that
the name of the mysterious 'person' was not revealed in the
most secret correspondence between the Home Office and
Dublin Castle. At the termination of the troubles, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>when the need of secrecy became less urgent, and it was
desirable to bestow pensions on 'persons who had rendered
important service during the rebellion,' the name of Samuel
Turner is found in the Cornwallis Papers as entitled to 300<em>l.</em>
a year. But a foot-note from the indefatigable editor&mdash;Mr.
Ross&mdash;who spared no labour to acquire minute information,
confesses that it has been found impossible to procure any
particulars of Turner.</p>

<p>For years I have investigated the relations of the informers
with the Government, and Samuel Turner is the only large recipient
of 'blood-money' whose services remain to be accounted
for. Turner's name never appeared in any printed pension
list. Mr. Ross found the name at Dublin Castle, with some
others, in a 'confidential memorandum,' written for the
perusal of the Lord Lieutenant, whose fiat became necessary.
The money was 'given by a warrant dated December 20,
1800,' but the names were kept secret&mdash;the payments being
confidentially made by the Under-Secretary.</p>

<p>At this distance of time it is not easy to trace a life of
which Mr. Ross, thirty years earlier, failed to catch the
haziest glimpse; but I hope to make the case clear, and
Turner's history readable.</p>

<p>Previous to 1798 he is found posing in the double <em>r√¥le</em> of
martyr and hero&mdash;winning alternately the sympathy and
admiration of the people. Mr. Patrick O'Byrne, an aged
native of Newry, long connected with an eminent publishing
firm in Dublin, has replied to a letter of inquiry by supplying
some anecdotes in Turner's life. It is a remarkable proof of
the completeness with which Turner's perfidy was cloaked that
Mr. O'Byrne never heard his honesty questioned.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1836 there was a tradition current in Newry of a gentleman
named Turner, who in the previous generation had resided in a large
red brick house situated in the centre of a fine walled-in park called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Turner's Glen, on the western side of Newry, in the County Armagh.
Mr. Turner had been in 1796 a member of the great confederacy of
United Irishmen, one of the leaders who, for self and fellows, 'pledged
his life, his fortune, and his honour' to put an end to British
supremacy in Ireland. About the date mentioned the notorious
Luttrell, Lord Carhampton, who was commander of the forces in
Ireland at the time, and was then making a tour of inspection of
the army, had to pass through Newry. The chief hotel in Newry
at that time adjoined the post-office. The gentry and merchants of
Newry generally went to the post-office shortly after the arrival of
the mails to get their letters, and while waiting for the mail to be
assorted promenaded in front of the hotel, or rested in the coffee-room.
Mr. Turner wore the colours he affected&mdash;a large green
necktie. Lord Carhampton, while his horses were being changed,
was looking out of the coffee-room windows of the hotel, and
his eye lighted on the rebel 'stock:' here was a fine opportunity to
cow a rebel and assert his own courage&mdash;a quality for which he was
not noted. Accordingly he swaggered up to Mr. Turner and, confronting
him, asked 'Whose man are you, who dares to wear that
rebellious emblem?' Mr. Turner sternly replied, 'I am my own
man. Whose man are you, who dares to speak so insolently to an
Irish gentleman?' 'I am one who will make you wear a hempen
necktie, instead of your flaunting French silk, if you do not instantly
remove it!' retorted Lord Carhampton. 'I wear this colour,'
replied Mr. Turner courageously, 'because I like it. As it is
obnoxious to you, come and take it off.' Carhampton, finding that
his bluster did not frighten the North Erin rebel, turned to leave;
but Turner, by a rapid movement, got between him and the door,
and, presenting his card to the general, demanded his address. Carhampton
told him he would learn it sooner than he should like.
Turner thereupon said, 'I <em>must</em> know your name; until now I have
never had the misfortune to be engaged in a quarrel with aught but
gentlemen, who knew how to make themselves responsible for their
acts. You cannot insult me with impunity, whatever your name
may be. I will yet find it out, and post you in every court as a
coward.' The Commander of the Forces withdrew from Newry,
having come off second best in the quarrel he had provoked. Mr.
Turner, for reasons connected with the cause in which he had
embarked, was obliged to lie <em>perdu</em> soon after, and so Carhampton
escaped the 'posting' he would, under other circumstances, have
got from the Northern fire-eater.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The general accuracy of Mr. O'Byrne's impressions is
shown by the 'Life and Confessions of Newell the Informer,'
printed for the author at London in 1798.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Newell travelled
with the staff of Lord Carhampton, and in April, 1797, witnessed
the scene between Turner and him.</p>

<p>Newell's pamphlet, which created much noise at the time
and had a large circulation, did not tend to weaken popular
confidence in Turner. It appeared soon after the time that
he had begun to play false; but Newell, with all his cunning,
had no suspicion of Turner.</p>

<p>The late Mr. J. Mathews, of Dundalk, collected curious
details regarding the rebel organisation of Ulster in 1797.
With these details the name of Samuel Turner is interwoven,
but, although the object of Mathews was to expose the treachery
of some false brothers, he assigns to Turner the rank of a
patriot and a hero. How the authorities, by a <em>coup</em>, made a
number of arrests, is described; and how Turner, after some
exciting adventures, got safely to France.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The spy on this occasion was Mr. Conlan, a medical
practitioner in Dundalk. A sworn information, signed by
Conlan, is preserved among the Sirr MSS. in Trinity College,
Dublin. It is dated 1798, when Turner himself was betraying
his own colleagues to Pitt! Conlan states that one evening,
after Turner had left his house at Newry to attend a meeting
of United Irishmen at Dundalk, the officer in command at
the barracks of Newry got orders to march on Dundalk and
arrest the leaders. An officer's servant apprised Corcoran,
who was an adherent of Turner's. Corcoran mounted a
horse and galloped to Dundalk, where he arrived in time
to warn Turner. Conlan recollected Turner and Teeling
travelling through Ulster and holding meetings for organisation
at Dundalk, Newry, Ballinahinch (the site of the
subsequent battle), Ronaldstown, Glanary, and in Dublin at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Kearn's, Kildare Street,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> where the principal meetings were
held.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>I find in the Pelham MSS. the examination of Dr. John
Macara, one of the Northern State prisoners of 1797. It
supplies details of the plan of attack which had been foiled
by the arrests. 'Newry was to be attacked by Samuel
Turner, of Newry aforesaid, with the men from Newry and
Mourn.'<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It was not Conlan alone who reported Turner's movements
to the Crown. Francis Higgins, the ablest secret agent of
Under-Secretary Cooke, announces that Turner had sent
'letters from Portsmouth for the purpose of upholding and
misleading the mutinous seamen into avowed rebellion;'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and some weeks later he states that 'Turner had returned
from Hamburg with an answer to the Secret Committee of
United Irishmen.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>We know on the authority of James Hope, who wrote down
his 'Recollections' of this time at the request of a friend, that
Turner, having fled from Ireland, filled the office of resident
agent at Hamburg of the United Irishmen. The Irish envoys
and refugees, finding themselves in a place hardly less strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>than Tierra del Fuego, ignorant of its language, its rules
and its ways, sought on arrival the accredited agent of their
brotherhood, hailed him with joy, and regarded the spot on
which he dwelt as a bit of Irish soil sacred to the Shamrock.
The hardship which some of the refugees went through was
trying enough. James Hope, writing in 1846, says that
Palmer, one of Lord Edward's bodyguard in Dublin, travelled,
'mostly barefooted, from Paris to Hamburg, where he put
himself into communication with Samuel Turner.' The
object of Palmer's mission was to expose one Bureaud, then
employed as a spy by Holland. 'Palmer,' writes Hope,
'gave Turner a gold watch to keep for him.' He enlisted in
a Dutch regiment, and was found drowned in the Scheldt.
'When Turner,' adds Hope, 'was applied to for the watch by
Palmer's sister, he replied that he forgot what became of it.'</p>

<p>Hamburg in troubled times was a place of great importance
for the maintenance of intercourse between England
and France. Here, as Mr. Froude states, 'Lord Downshire's
friend' had vast facilities for getting at the inmost secrets of
the United Irishmen. Hope's casual statement serves to show
how it was that this 'person' could have had access to
Lady Edward Fitzgerald's confidence, and that of her political
friends at Hamburg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

FATHER O'COIGLY HANGED</h2>


<p>Mr. Froude, after a perusal of the letters of Downshire's
friend, and other documents, states that a priest named
O'Coigly or Quigley 'had visited Paris in 1797, returned to
Dublin, and had been with Lord Edward Fitzgerald at Leinster
House; that he was now going back to Paris, and Arthur
O'Connor determined to go in his company.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Their mission,
though ostensibly for presenting an address from the London
corresponding society of United Irishmen to the French Government,
was really for the double purpose of urging upon it the
prompt despatch of an invading fleet to Ireland, and of deposing
the Irish envoy, Lewins, who, instead of Turner, had begun to
be suspected. Mr. Lawless, afterwards Lord Cloncurry, invited
O'Coigly to dinner in London; and it was on this occasion
that O'Connor met the priest for the first time. O'Coigly,
under the name of Captain Jones, with Allen<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> seemingly as his
servant, and Leary, left London for Margate, on their mission
of mystery. O'Connor travelled by another route to Margate,
took the name of Colonel Morris, and was accompanied by
Binns. On the following day, at the King's Head Inn, Margate,
all the party were arrested by two Bow Street officers.
O'Coigly and O'Connor had dined at Lawless's lodgings more
than once; and here, though not necessarily with his knowledge,
the travelling arrangements seem to have been made.
Whether Turner was a guest does not appear; but he was
certainly in London at this time, and as one of the Executive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Committee is likely to have been invited. Presently it will be
shown that from this quarter came all the information which
enabled Pitt to seize O'Connor and O'Coigly at Margate <i lang="fr">en
route</i> to France, although, to elude observation, they had
journeyed by different roads. The prisoners, meanwhile, were
removed to London, examined before the Privy Council, and
then transmitted to Maidstone Jail to await their trial. The
source of the information which caused these historic arrests
on February 27, 1798, has hitherto remained a mystery.
Father O'Coigly, while in jail, wrote some letters, in which he
failed to avow his share in the conspiracy, but admitted to
have made a previous visit to Cuxhaven. This was part of
the city of Hamburg. Turner, in addition to being the official
agent of the United Irishmen at Hamburg, was an old Dundalk
acquaintance of O'Coigly's, and no doubt was promptly hailed
by the country priest.</p>

<p>Turner and O'Coigly are mentioned in Hughes's information.
They belonged to the same district organisation. After describing
Teeling, Turner and Lowry working in concert in 1797,
Hughes adds that priest Quigly or O'Coigly introduced him
at that time to Baily and Binns.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The paper revealed by Mr.
Froude, now shown to be Turner's, and other letters from the
same hand in the 'Castlereagh Papers,' show that the writer
always felt a strong dislike to work with the 'Papists,' especially
priests. 'Casey, the red-faced, designing Dublin priest,'
was one of the leading men he met in Dublin, and whose
'prudence or cowardice' disgusted him. Immediately after
O'Coigly's return to London we find the authorities on his
track. The priest himself refers to an abortive attempt to arrest
him by night at Piccadilly.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Mr. Froude, dealing with this case,
does not seem to have suspected that the arrival in London
of Downshire's friend, at the time of the arrests at Margate,
was other than accidental. Yet clearly it was business
of no ordinary moment which brought him back to London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>at this time. It will be remembered that, panic-stricken and
fearing death from the assassin's knife, he had returned to
Hamburg in October 1797, ere an answer came from Pitt to
the proposition of betrayal conveyed by Lord Downshire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It happened that at this particular time [writes Mr. Froude] that
Downshire's friend was in London, and Pelham (the Irish Secretary)
knew it. If the 'friend' could be brought over, and could be induced
to give evidence, a case could then be established against all
the United Irish leaders. They could be prosecuted with certainty
of conviction, and the secrets of the plot could be revealed so fully
that the reality of it could no longer be doubted.</p>

<p>Most earnestly Camden<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> begged Portland<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> to impress on the
'friend' the necessity of compliance. 'Patriotism might induce
him to overcome his natural prejudice.' If patriotism was insufficient,
there was no reward which he ought not to receive.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Portland's
answer was not encouraging: 'The friend,' he said, 'shall be
detained. As to his coming over to you, I have reason to believe
that there is not any consideration on earth which would tempt
him to undertake it. He is convinced that he would go to utter
destruction. Better he should stay here and open a correspondence
with some of the principal conspirators, by which means you may
be apprised of their intentions. If I could be satisfied, or if you
would give it as your positive opinion that this person's testimony
or presence would crush the conspiracy, or bring any principal
traitor to justice, I should not, and Lord Downshire would not,
hesitate to use any influence to prevail on his friend to run any risk
for such an object. But if he should fail and escape with his life,
he could render no further service. Weigh well, therefore, the
consequence of such a sacrifice.'<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></div>

<p>After describing the arrest at Margate of Father O'Coigly,
O'Connor, and Binns, Mr. Froude writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>O'Connor wrote a hurried note to Lord Edward, telling him not
to be alarmed, nothing having been taken upon them which compromised
any individual.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The messenger to whom the note was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>entrusted was unfortunate or treacherous, for it fell into the
hands of the Government. <em>Had O'Connor known the connection
between the Government and Lord Downshire's friend, he would
have felt less confident.</em> There was evidence, if it could only be
produced, which would send both Lord Edward and himself to the
scaffold.</p></div>

<p>It may be observed here&mdash;<i lang="fr">en parenth√®se</i>&mdash;that Downshire
must have felt conflicting emotions when called upon to communicate
information which might bring Lord Edward to the
block. His father had married the sister of James, Duke of
Leinster; Lord Edward was, therefore, the first cousin of
Lord Downshire.</p>

<p>One of the most truthful chapters of the laudatory life of
Reynolds, the informer,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> is that aiming to show that he could
not have been the spy who caused the arrests at Margate.
But the biographer is unable to offer any suggestion as to who
that agent was&mdash;so carefully veiled from Reynolds, one of
their own confidential prompters, was the part played by
Turner in that episode.</p>

<p>The information which led to the arrest of O'Connor,
O'Coigly, and his companion cannot have come from Ireland,
because in the 'Book of Secret Service Monies expended in
the Detection of Treasonable Conspiracies' no entry appears
connected with the above incident, unless 'Dutton's Expenses
going to England to attend Quigly's Trial,' and where he
had merely to swear to the priest's handwriting. For his
courage in doing this&mdash;having once seen him sign a lottery
ticket at Dundalk&mdash;50<em>l.</em> is paid to 'Dutton on June 12,
1798.' The names of Newell and Murdoch certainly appear
in the 'Secret Service Money' book about that time; but
it is clear from Newell's narrative&mdash;doubtless a genuine
and frank confession&mdash;that neither he nor Murdoch had
any hand in tracing the movements of O'Coigly and
O'Connor.</p>

<p>Lord Castlereagh was now acting for Pelham as Chief
Secretary for Ireland. On July 25, 1798, a secret letter&mdash;printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in the 'Castlereagh Papers'&mdash;is addressed to him from
the Home Office:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am directed by the Duke of Portland to inform your Lordship
that I have received intelligence from <em>a person very much in the
confidence of [Reinhard] the French Minister at Hamburg</em>,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that
several French officers and soldiers have lately arrived at that
place, where they have purchased sailor's dresses, clothed themselves
in them, and gone on to Denmark and Sweden, from whence
it is intended that they should embark for the North of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
I know not what credit is to be given to this information, which
must be received with caution, as it does not appear to have reached
his Majesty's Minister at Hamburg.</p>

<p>It comes, however, from a person<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> whose reports while he was
in this country<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> were known to his Excellency as singularly
accurate and faithful&mdash;<em>the same who gave such an accurate
account of the proceedings of O'Connor and Coigly</em> whilst they
were in this country, and on whose authority those persons were
apprehended.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></div>

<p>Some of the letters of 'Lord Downshire's friend,' not
being forthcoming in the official archives, Mr. Froude assumed
that they had been destroyed; but, however masked,
they are recognisable in the 'Castlereagh Correspondence.'
Several anonymous papers, furnishing information of the
movements of the United Irishmen about Hamburg and
elsewhere, crop up in that book, having been enclosed
from Whitehall for the guidance of Dublin Castle. One
of these letters makes special reference to information already
sent to Lord Downshire.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Another long letter of the same batch will be found the first
placed in the second volume of Castlereagh, though an examination
of it shows that it belongs to the middle of the previous
volume. Detailed reference is made to Father O'Coigly's
mission and movements, both in France and in London. One
is struck by the accuracy of its information regarding the
Ulster United Irishmen, of whom Turner was one. Of MacMahon,
who travelled to Paris with O'Coigly, we learn that,
'<em>tired of politics</em>, especially those of France, he is to write to
Citoyen Jean Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> <i lang="fr">√† la poste restante √† Hamburg</i>, whom
he looks on as a good patriot.'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It will be remembered that
a similar phrase occurs in the letter of Downshire's friend,
printed by Froude, <em>i.e.</em> Rowan had 'professed himself sick
of politics.' Again, 'I found Maitland and Stewart, of Acton,
both heartily sick of politics.'</p>

<p>How to hang O'Coigly was now the difficulty. The
Government knew&mdash;from somebody who had worked with
him&mdash;that he was deep in the treason; but nothing could
persuade the informer to prosecute him openly.</p>

<p>On April 11, 1798, Wickham writes from Whitehall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is most exceedingly to be lamented that no person can be sent
over from Ireland to prove Coigly's handwriting. Proof of that
kind would be so extremely material, that I have no doubt that the
law officers would think it right to put off the trial if they could
have any hope of any person being found, in a short time, who could
speak distinctly to his handwriting.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p></div>

<p>The secret adviser who, as Portland said, 'should be
detained,' worked his brain until at length a man, hailing
from a place suspiciously familiar to Turner, is sent for to
swear to the point. Samuel Turner, formerly of Newry, had
intimate knowledge of every man in the place. One Frederick
Dutton, described as 'of Newry,' was now subp≈ìnaed by the
Crown to swear to O'Coigly's handwriting in a letter addressed
to Lord Edward Fitzgerald. 'He claimed to have seen Coigly
write his name for the purpose of getting a watch raffled which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>belonged to a poor man under sentence of death.' Dutton
had been a dismissed servant and had kept a public-house at
Newry without a licence.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Turner&mdash;it seems absurd to doubt the identity&mdash;got back to
London on Tuesday, May 15, 1798. What secret help he gave
to the law officers can only be inferred, for they pledged themselves
that he should never be asked to come forward publicly.
Though O'Connor, O'Coigly, and Binns<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> were arrested on
March 1, their trials did not take place till late in May 1798.
The Duke of Norfolk, Lords Moira, Suffolk, Oxford, John
Russell, and Thanet, Fox, Sheridan, Whitbread, Erskine,
Grattan, all testified to O'Connor's character. All the prisoners
were acquitted, except the priest, notwithstanding that Lord
Cloncurry paid a counsel to defend him. He was hanged
on Penenden Heath, June 7, 1798. Judge Buller had leant
heavily on O'Coigly in his charge.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>O'Coigly [writes Lord Holland] was condemned on false and
contradictory evidence. I do not mean to aver, as Lord Chancellor
Thurlow assured me he did to Judge Buller, who tried him, that
'<em>if ever a poor man was murdered it was O'Coigly</em>,' but simply to
allude to a circumstance which, in the case of a common felon,
would probably have saved his life. The Bow Street officer who
swore to finding the fatal paper in his pocket-book, and remarked
in court the folding of the paper as fitting that pocket-book, had
sworn before the Privy Council that the same paper <em>was found loose
in O'Coigly's great-coat, and, I think, had added that he himself
had put it into the pocket-book</em>. An attorney of the name of
Foulkes<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> gave me this information, and I went with it to Mr.
Wickham, who assured me that the circumstance should be carefully
and anxiously investigated before the execution. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>order had gone down, and while we were conversing the sentence
was probably executed.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></div>

<p>Lord Holland adds that when the Judge was descanting
on the mildness and clemency of the Administration, O'Coigly
quietly took a pinch of snuff and said 'Ahem!'</p>

<p>When no evidence was produced in court which could
legally ensure a verdict against O'Coigly, it seems reasonable
to assume from the tone of the law officers and the Judge that
they possessed some secret knowledge of his guilt, for in point
of fact, though O'Coigly declared his innocence, he was deeply
pledged to the conspiracy.</p>

<p>'O'Connor was leaving the court in triumph,' writes Mr.
Froude, 'but the Government knew their man too well to let
him go so easily. He was at once re-arrested on another
charge, and was restored to his old quarters in Dublin Castle.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
From whom the fatal whisper came does not appear, but the
sequel seems to leave no doubt that to Turner it was due.
MacMahon and other prominent rebels were Presbyterian
clergymen of Ulster. It was an object now with those who
desired the collapse of the conspiracy to detach the Presbyterian
party from the 'Papists.' Binns was a staunch Presbyterian
rebel, a colleague of O'Coigly. In a letter dated
Philadelphia, 1843, Binns, addressing Dr. Madden, states that
great efforts were used to try and persuade O'Coigly to implicate
him, 'offering Mr. Coigly his life if he would criminate me
agreeable to the instructions of the Government, which proposal
he indignantly refused to accede to. Though heavily
ironed, he pushed the gentlemen out of his cell, when he there
lay under sentence of death.'</p>

<p>We have seen that when severely tried he resorted to
snuff. He had other small consolations. Even in his irons
he talked irony. One of several letters of protest addressed
by the priest to Portland, shortly before his death, tells him
that he is 'one of his Grace's envoys to the other world,
charged with tidings of his mild and merciful administration.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>As O'Coigly's memory has been all but beatified as a
martyr's, it is due to the interests of historic truth to add&mdash;especially
after the remarks of Lord Holland&mdash;the following
from a letter written by Arthur O'Connor in 1842:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though there was not legal evidence to prove that the paper
found in Coigly's coat-pocket was Coigly's, yet, the fact is, it was
his, and was found in his riding-coat; for when the five prisoners
were brought to Bow Street, a report was spread that the papers
taken on the prisoners were lost; for the first time Coigly said it
was fortunate the papers were lost, for that there was one in his
pocket that would hang them all. He never made a secret to his
fellow-prisoners that he got that paper from a London society. In
my memoirs I will clear up this point.</p></div>

<p>O'Connor's promised work, however, never appeared.</p>

<p>As regards Dutton, the witness who swore to O'Coigly's
handwriting, his subsequent career was cast on a spot also
frequented by Turner.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He is found at Cuxhaven, not very far
from Hamburg, and, until 1840, holding office in its postal and
diplomatic departments, and the husband of a lady well connected.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Cuxhaven, as gazetteers record, was from 1795 a place
of the utmost importance for the maintenance of intercourse
between England and the Continent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

THE BETRAYER'S INTERVIEW WITH TALLEYRAND</h2>


<p>The letters of secret information in the well-known 'Castlereagh
Correspondence' being mostly without date are inserted regardless
of chronological sequence, and are often, from dearth of
explanation, wholly unintelligible. One of these secret reports
follows a letter of Portland's<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>&mdash;to be found later on&mdash;regarding
the intercepted memorial which Dr. McNevin had addressed
to the French Government. The particular references to Lord
Downshire, to Hamburg, to Fitzgerald, and to the North of
Ireland, of which Turner was a native&mdash;not to speak of his
'tone of injured innocence,' 'the dread of those from whom
I come as to the ascendency of the Papists'&mdash;all point to him
as the writer.</p>

<p>His tone as usual is hostile to Lewins, a Roman Catholic
envoy of great honesty, whose reputation he is ever seeking
to injure; and the intrigue, it may be added, very nearly succeeded
in getting Lewins superseded. Mr. Froude, it will be
remembered, when describing his unmasked informer writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lady Edward Fitzgerald had sent him on to Paris with a letter
to her brother-in-law, General Valence. By Valence he had been
introduced to Hoche and De la Croix. He had seen Talleyrand
and had <em>talked</em> at length with him on the condition of Ireland.</p></div>

<p>It was in February, 1798, that Mr. Froude's spy reappeared
in London.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> He had interviews at the Home Office,
where he received some instructions, which are not stated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Camden urged Portland to beg of him to give evidence publicly,
and to offer reward to any amount. But all to no
effect. At last it was decided, as the next best thing to do,
'that he should open a correspondence with the principal
conspirators, by which means you may be apprised of their
intentions.' This is exactly what he is now found doing. On
April 17 he goes to Paris, no doubt sent by the Home Office,
to ascertain what arrangement had been made by O'Coigly
and O'Connor as regards the long-sought French expedition to
Ireland.</p>

<p>De la Croix will be chiefly remembered as the Minister for
Foreign Affairs with whom Tone had to do. But he had
been personally offensive to Lord Malmesbury, the English
Minister, and M. Talleyrand was appointed to succeed La
Croix on July 15, 1797.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The following letter is to be found in the 'Castlereagh
Papers' (i. 231-6), and derives additional importance from
its close connection with Talleyrand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Secret Intelligence.</span></p>

<p>April 17th [1798], arrived in Paris.</p>

<p>On the 19th waited on the Minister for Foreign Affairs; it being
D√©cadi, he was gone to the country. Left my name, and called
next day, at eleven; instantly admitted; <em>talked</em> over the purport
of my visit, which I had brought in writing, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Citizen Minister,&mdash;Since I had the honor of seeing you in September
last, I understand attempts have been made to injure my
character here by some persons equally despicable as malicious (I
mean Lewines and his associates), from whom, though United
Irishmen, I pride myself in differing, both in sentiment and conduct;
nor should I condescend to answer their infamous charges.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>'I, however, take great pleasure in acquainting you with what I
have been about, viz., trying to bring over to the side of the United
Irish what is called the Independent Interest, <em>alias</em> the Country
Gentlemen, all of whom have commands either in the Yeomanry or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><em>Militia</em>,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and to whom the safety of the interior will be entrusted,
whilst the regular troops march against the enemy. These gentlemen
have always been much against the Government, but feared,
in a revolution, the loss of their property, especially such as held
their estates by grants of Oliver Cromwell. For some time past a
union has been formed among this body for the purpose of forcing
England into whatever measures they choose as soon as an invasion
takes place; all of my most particular friends are of this association,
and they have infused into the minds of the rest the idea that
English faith is not to be relied on. In consequence, they are all
now completely up to the formation of a Republic and a separation
from Britain, provided the French Directory will give, under their
seal, the terms and conditions Ireland has a right to expect and
demands. I took upon me to say France never meant to treat
Ireland has a conquered country; that, certainly, they would expect
a contribution towards defraying the great expense incurred in
supporting the cause of liberty; but what the sum would be, I
could not take upon me to mention. They insist upon having that
specified, and any other conditions for this purpose.</p>

<p>'Citizen Minister, I now apply to you; to none other have I
hinted my business, and the most profound secrecy will be requisite
in order to completely deceive the English Government. I shall
mention to you the channel of correspondence, &amp;c., with the ciphers
I'll make use of, if it is requisite to write, but which I sha'n't do
without your permission, and giving you the letter to enclose to
Hamburg.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Thus far the letter of Turner to Talleyrand&mdash;for Turner it
assuredly is. It does not follow that the Minister believed all
he was told. The quondam Bishop of Autun could read a
soul. He was a diplomat, however, and showed to his visitor
that cautious courtesy which he had learned when a bishop.
He who said that speech is given to conceal thoughts,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> was not
the man to be at once swayed by words. The despatch now
before us had been addressed to the Home Office, and must
be one of the papers Mr. Froude thought destroyed. The
copy of his letter to Talleyrand having been submitted to
Portland, the spy thus resumes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Minister then said it was a matter extremely interesting,
that other things were on the <em>tapis</em> at present, but desired I would
call again on the second uneven day from that, and he'd<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> enter
into particulars. I did so, and gave him the following letter. He
said he had laid my first before the Directory; that their opinions
coincided with his, but that they could not give anything under
their hands or seal, nor he either; that I had perfectly expressed
their intentions. I told him this was perfectly satisfactory to me,
but I feared it would not be so to them. 'Surely,' says he, 'they
have a confidence in you, and you shall have it from the Directory,
if you choose.' I said I hoped that would be sufficiently satisfactory
to my friends, and begged to know when I could see him
again&mdash;the 1st of the next decade, as they were still very busy on
other matters.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Copy of the Letter to Talleyrand.</em></p>

<p>'Citizen Minister,&mdash;Wishing to give the Government every satisfaction
on the point of my mission, I now have the honour of
laying before you every particular. I am extremely glad to find
it appears to you interesting, which induces me to hope as little
delay will be given as possible. I think it incumbent on me to
state to you that the spirit of the North is completely broken, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>I fear shortly the rest of Ireland will be in the same predicament.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
A vast number of the persons concerned in persecuting the United
Irish are those from whom I come; for at present they dread, and
with good reason, the ascendency of this body. As soon as you
set these gentlemen's minds at ease in regard to their property,
the business of revolution will get leave to go on, and the British
Government will find themselves clogged in their system of terror,
without knowing why. The enclosed paper contains the mode in
which I am to act, &amp;c., &amp;c. I have the honour, &amp;c.'</p></div>

<p>Turner then adds:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Enclosure, containing the ciphers I sent to the Marquess of
Downshire, and the following postscript:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The intention of the ciphers was, if I thought it requisite to
write from Paris, to say who I had had communication with and as
a channel of conveying any intelligence you might allow me to send
during my stay. The letter to be addressed to Charles Ranken,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Esq., at Mr. Elliot's, Pimlico, London, to be put in the common
post-office at Hamburg, and sealed with a particular seal I have
for the purpose. As soon as I receive the proper paper or document,
in order to save time, I am to get, if possible, into England;
if that can't be done with safety, I'm to go to either Bremen or
Hamburg, write thence to Ranken, who comes over before him. I
attest the business on oath, and he goes instantly for Ireland.
Ranken,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> having been a banker at Belfast, a man of good property,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>and looked on by Government as a friend, can pass and repass as
if to settle accounts at Hamburg.</p>

<p>'I beg leave once more to inform you that delay will be looked
on, I fear, as non-compliance; and, if there's any particular point
on which you wish for accurate information, I think I can undertake
to obtain it.'</p></div>

<p>The spy's letter then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He (Talleyrand) seemed to disapprove of my venturing to Ireland
or England; asked me if I knew anything of Fitzgerald.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Waited on him the first of the following decade; he said
nothing was resolved on. I asked if the Irish were to wait for
their coming or not. He said by all means to wait, and not to
risk or expose themselves. 'May I assure them you'll come in
the course of three months?' 'No, we cannot fix a time; it may
be more, or not so long. I shall depend on you to obtain for me
as accurate a statement, with as much information as you can
collect.' I desired to know on what particular point, otherwise I
should be at a loss; he said he could not mention any particular.
I then promised as much as I could collect in general, with a
particular and accurate one of Ireland. I then asked if I might
venture to assert that the French Government would be content
with being paid the expense of their former expedition, and of that
which will be sent; that they will leave the Irish to choose a constitution
for themselves as soon as English influence is destroyed;
guaranteeing to every individual their property, without respect to
old Catholic claims and to their political conduct prior to the time
of actual invasion. 'You may venture to assure them that the
property of no individual will be seized upon, but the reverse. On
the other points we cannot give an answer.'&mdash;'When shall I see
the Directory?'&mdash;'On the ninth of this decade I shall speak to the
President, and you may bring to me one of your acquaintance that
is known to him, who will introduce you;' or that I might go
alone, as my name was sufficiently known to him. Between that
and the 9th I spoke to Abb√© Gr√©goire<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> to accompany me; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>declined it, as did Stone;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> upon which I wrote, on the 8th, to the
Minister, to say that these two had refused, and that they thought
he himself ought to do it, or give me a note of introduction to the
President; but that, if it was disagreeable, I would not press the
matter further, as I looked on his word as that of the Directory,
and that I would call next day at the Directory, when, if I could
get an audience, so much the better; if not, I thought it imprudent
to wait longer.</p>

<p>Next day I called at the Directory and sent in my name. I
there met Duckett,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> who told me it would be impossible to see any
of them that day; for a letter, which he had just brought them,
which came from Leonard Bourdon,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> would give them, he believed,
work enough, as he understood it contained some very interesting
matter. I was to have seen some of them that day likewise; an
answer came to us both that they were too much occupied. I then
went to the Minister, and sent in my name, as did, at the same
time, Colonel La Harpe and the Swiss Deputies. We were all
sent off, as he was very busy. I left a note with his Secretary,
saying I would set out next day, which I did, the 20 Floreal, alias
Wednesday, the 9th May; arrived at Cuxhaven the Wednesday
following; sailed the next day, landed at Lowestoff on Tuesday
morning, got to town [London] that night, accompanied by one
Jeffrey,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> who passes himself off for a Scotchman, was coming to Yarmouth
as an American, was in Paris last September, speaks French
as a Frenchman, looks extremely like one, and lodges at the New
Hummums, Covent Garden.</p></div>

<p>It is quite clear that the above letter was written by the
same nameless spy who poses in Froude's book as 'Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Downshire's friend.' '<em>One</em> of his letters, dated November 19,
1797, is preserved,' writes Mr. Froude; but, no doubt, a few
others are preserved too, and may be found in the correspondence
of Lord Castlereagh. How they escaped destruction
is a marvel. Wickham, on January 11, 1799, writes, regarding
'United Irishmen' at Hamburg: 'The enclosed very
curious papers the Duke of Portland desires may be laid
before the Lord Lieutenant, <em>and afterwards destroyed</em>.'</p>

<p>So careful was the spy of his reputation that he
vouchsafes not a signature. Internal evidence, however, shows
that he was the man who made his disclosure to Downshire,
and was by him put in correspondence with Portland.</p>

<p>From the letter just quoted it appears that, after his
efforts to pick news from Talleyrand and fish in Irish channels
at Paris, he returned, <em>vi√¢</em> Cuxhaven, to London, where he
arrived on Tuesday night, May 15, 1798. This date is worthy
of note. The spy feared to show himself in London and
felt that his life was unsafe. What brings him back to London
on May 15, 1798? His favourite post was Cuxhaven or
Hamburg. O'Coigly, Binns, and Leary, though arrested
in March <i lang="fr">en route</i> to France, were not put on their trial until
Monday, May 21, 1798. This case is reported at extraordinary
length in Howell's 'State Trials' and would fill a volume.
Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon, prosecuted. The mass of secret
information which the Crown contrived to acquire strikes very
forcibly. Letters written in cipher by O'Coigly to Lord
Edward Fitzgerald and others are translated and expounded
by Scott. All the parties concerned in the conspiracy had
false names. Mrs. Mathiessen<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> is called 'Marks;' 'a man
going to William's,' means 'going to France,' etc. It was
largely on evidence of this sort that O'Coigly was convicted
and hanged.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The betrayer tells Talleyrand that 'the spirit of the North
was completely broken.' In point of fact, however, it was in
the North that the real martial spirit of the United Irishmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>blazed, and there the best battles were afterwards fought under
the leadership of Orr and Monroe. Turner was anxious to
make the French turn their thoughts of invasion to other
points on the Irish coast, and he so far succeeded that in
August, 1798, Humbert's expedition, embracing not 1,000
men, landed at Killala, among the starved and unarmed
peasantry of Connaught. He calculated on meeting enthusiastic
support; but, as Mr. Lecky says, it soon became apparent
how fatally he had been deceived. After winning
one battle, and losing another, Humbert surrendered to
Cornwallis.</p>

<p>'May I assure them that you'll come in three months?'
Talleyrand is asked. The object of this and other questions,
which, to a casual reader, seem hardly consistent with Turner's
treachery to his friends, is now pretty plain. Great doubt
prevailed as to whether an invasion of Ireland was really to
be attempted. The First Consul blew hot and cold upon it.
If the spy, as an envoy of the United Irishmen, could only
extort from Talleyrand an explicit reply in writing avowing
the intention to invade, and telling the exact time on
which the descent on Ireland was to be made, England
would thus be well prepared, and her fleet able to destroy the
French armament as she had already destroyed that of De
Winter. Why Bonaparte, at first so anxious for invasion,
should have changed his mind, is explained, in the recently
published Memoirs of Gouverneur Morris, as due to the
conflicting reports of Irish envoys. At St. Helena he told
Las Cases that his mistake in '98 was to have gone to Egypt
and not to Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Froude states that the betrayer had discovered one of
the objects of the Papists to be the seizure of property, and
had determined to separate himself from the conspiracy.
Attention is requested to that part of the foregoing letter<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
where the writer refers to the Cromwellian holders of estates
in Ireland, and asks that every individual be guaranteed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>property without respect to old Catholic claims and to their
political conduct prior to the time of actual invasion. Samuel
Turner represented some of the Cromwellian Settlers, and 'his
most particular friends,' as he calls them, were amongst
those who held grants of land in succession to the old Papist
proprietary. The descendants of these men viewed invasion
with alarm, lest their lands should go, just as the property of
the Papists had already gone.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Talleyrand's caution in talking with Turner contrasts with
the freedom with which he opened his mind on the same
subject to his <em>confr√®res</em>. A very important book was published
in 1890 at Paris by M. Pallain, 'Talleyrand sous le
Directoire.' It depicts his diplomatic life, and gives the
pith of his despatches. From Turner and Duckett he probably
derived some impressions regarding Great Britain and
Ireland. He augurs well from the Irish rebellion, which has
been 'cemented,' adds Talleyrand, 'by the blood of celebrated
victims.' The first victim was the Rev. William Jackson,
in 1794. Talleyrand urges the invasion of Ireland and the
establishment of an Irish Republic 'for the instruction or
chastisement of England.' 'Nelson's fleet,' he says, 'is
manned almost exclusively by Irishmen,' and that their
patriotism 'will teach them to see in the English their oppressors
and enemies.' Talleyrand's sketch of 'Irish Landed
Proprietors' is full and curious.</p>

<p>Another man who, besides Talleyrand and Gr√©goire, dealt
cautiously with Turner was Stone, as Turner in his secret
letter to the Home Office admits. Stone had been tried in
England for high treason and sent into exile.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> At Hamburg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>and at Paris he belonged to the set mentioned by Mr.
Froude's cloaked spy<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> as including Lady Edward Fitzgerald
(Pamela), Lady Lucy Fitzgerald, Mrs. Matthiessen, and
General Count Valence. Madame de Genlis in her 'Memoirs'
mentions Stone conjointly with her daughter Madame de
Valence and her 'niece' Pamela.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

Cromwellian Settlers never thought of joining the United Irishmen. One of
Turner's objects seems to have been to get a written undertaking from Talleyrand
that the estates of these Settlers should be left intact, and money sent to
promote an alleged treasonable conspiracy of Cromwellian Settlers against
England, but which, in point of fact, did not exist. The Ulster Presbyterians
were, no doubt, rebels; but these men were the descendants, not of the Cromwellian
adventurers, but of King James's Planters.</p></div>

folios, dated May 9, 1794, and explaining his intercourse with Stone.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

LORD CLONCURRY SHADOWED</h2>


<p>Discoveries and arrests now multiplied, despite the care with
which Reinhard and Lady Edward persuaded themselves that
all negotiations had been fenced.</p>

<p>Lord Cloncurry in his Memoirs writes of his 'dear friend
Lord Edward Fitzgerald,' and readers of that book will remember
the touching narrative given of the writer's arrest and
long confinement in the Tower. This peer seeks to show that
he himself was innocent of treason, but Mr. Froude states, after
studying the letters of Lord Downshire's friend, that 'Lord
Cloncurry was a sworn member of the Revolutionary Committee.'<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The betrayer's first interview with Downshire took
place on October 8, 1797. In that interview he ranked
among the marked men, Lawless, afterwards Lord Cloncurry.
During the next month we find his movements narrowly
watched. One of Mr. Froude's sensational surprises is a
statement in reference to this subsequent British Peer and
Privy Councillor. Pelham, Chief Secretary for Ireland, writing
to the Home Office on November 7, 1797, refers to the fact&mdash;if
fact it is&mdash;that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Mr. Lawless, Lord Cloncurry's eldest son, is going to England
this night, charged with an answer to a message lately received
from France. I have sent Captain D'Auvergne in the packet with
Mr. Lawless, with directions to find where he means to go in
London, and to give you immediate information.'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>A story never loses in its carriage; and Portland was
perturbed by the news. The Hamburg spy, who was the first
to mention Lawless's name, was now consulted.</p>

<p>Two secret letters from the Home Office, dated June 8,
1798, and printed in Lord Castlereagh's 'Correspondence,'
speak of a communication received from '<em>a person</em> in Hamburg,'
and how</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'His Majesty's confidential servants have found it necessary to
take into custody and detain several natives of Ireland, now resident
here, of whose intimate connection and correspondence with the
leaders and inciters of the present rebellion in Ireland there was no
room whatever to doubt.... Communicate this information to the
Lord Lieutenant, that the Honourable Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. S., of Acton,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
and Messrs. T., A., and C.,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of the Temple, have been apprehended
here, and Messrs. McG&mdash;&mdash; and D&mdash;&mdash; at Liverpool;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and that
warrants for apprehending the following have been granted: Dr.
O'K&mdash;&mdash;, C&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of Abbey Street, Dublin, and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p></div>

<p>Lord Cloncurry states that the Duke of Leinster, Curran,
and Grattan, who happened to be visiting him, were also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>taken into custody; but this statement is not wholly borne out
by contemporary accounts.</p>

<p>Wickham's second letter of June 8, 1798, recurs to the
arrests and speaks of 'most secret, though accurate, intelligence
received from Hamburg,' adding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are some papers found in Mr. Lawless's possession that
tend directly to show his connection with some of the most desperate
of the Republican party here, as well as with those who are in
habitual communication with the French agents at <em>Hamburgh</em>, and
his Grace is in daily expectation of some material evidence <em>from
that place</em>, tending more directly to implicate that gentleman in a
treasonable correspondence with the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p></div>

<p>'Braughall' was another name which will be found in the
list written out by Downshire from his visitor's dictation.
Lord Cloncurry, in his Memoirs, describes Braughall as 'his
business agent and confidential friend;' while Tone constantly
refers to him in cordial terms. The newspapers of
the day record his arrest and how 'papers of a very seditious
nature were found in his house.'<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Among them was a letter
from Lawless urging him to contribute to the defence of
unfortunate O'Coigly, and mentioning that 'Little Henry'
had munificently subscribed. This passage, Lord Cloncurry
states, was interpreted at Dublin Castle as referring
to Henry Grattan, though the writer meant Mr. Henry of
Straffan, brother-in-law to Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>the result of this mistake Grattan was placed under arrest,
but speedily liberated.</p>

<p>A memoir of O'Coigly is furnished by Dr. Madden in the
first edition of his 'United Irishmen,' and embodies information
derived from Cloncurry. Deferring to the Hon. Mr.
Lawless, when in London, he says: 'Every Irishman who frequented
his house was vigilantly watched by <em>agents of a
higher department than the police</em>.' Pelham says that he sent
Captain D'Auvergne on board the packet with Lawless,
charged to find out where he went to in London; and it
would seem that during the tedious journey of those days,
Lawless suspected D'Auvergne's mission. 'The agent of
a higher department than the police' would also apply to
Turner, who was in London at this time. Who was the
detective who had his berth next to young Lawless on board
the boat, sat and chatted with him in the coach to London,
and afterwards dogged his steps? Letters furnishing secret
information, and signed 'Captain D'Auvergne, Prince of
Bouillon,' may be found in the 'Castlereagh Papers.'<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> This
personage represented an old and illustrious French family.
The Prince, finding his patrimony sequestered during the
Revolution, looked out for a livelihood, and seems to have
been not fastidious as to the sort. Cloncurry states that when
bidding good night at the house of a friend, he would say, 'I
haven't the conscience to keep my poor spy shivering longer in
the cold.' After 1798, D'Auvergne's usual post was Jersey,
whence his letters in the 'Castlereagh Papers' are dated, and
furnish the fruit of espionage, including all warlike preparations
made by the French at Brest.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Froude quotes a letter from Portland, part of which is
to the same effect as that already given, and announcing the
discovery of important papers 'in Mr. Lawless's [Cloncurry's]
possession that tend directly to show his connection with some
of the most desperate of the Republican party in England, as
well as with those who are in habitual communication with
the French agents at Hamburg; and yet,' he continued,
'under present circumstances, and with evidence of the
nature of that of which the Government here is in possession,
strong and decisive as it is, none of those persons can be
brought to trial without exposing secrets of the last importance
to the State, the revealing of which may implicate the safety
of the two kingdoms.'<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But although the leading men could
not be brought to trial, it was fit to hold them fast, that thus
the teeth of the conspiracy might be drawn. One important
man&mdash;Stewart of Acton&mdash;was certainly let out on bail; but
he was a cousin of Lord Castlereagh's.</p>

<p>These rough notes ought not to close without some notice
of a reply to Portland's criminatory remarks, which the late
Lord Cloncurry has placed on record. When the 'Castlereagh
Papers' appeared he was an octogenarian and enjoying, it is
to be hoped, an unimpaired memory; but it is an open secret
that the book known as 'Lord Cloncurry's Personal Memoirs'
was fully prepared for publication, and its style strengthened
throughout, by a practised writer connected with the Tory
press of Dublin, and who believed that Cloncurry had been
wrongly judged in 1798.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As to the papers alleged by Mr. Wickham to have been found in
my possession, [Lord Cloncurry is supposed to write] and tending
directly to show my connection with some of the most desperate of
the Republican party in London and Hamburgh, I now solemnly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>declare that I believe the statement to be <em>a pure fiction</em>, and that
no papers were found, as I am most certain that, with my knowledge,
no papers existed which could have had any such tendency,
more directly or indirectly than, perhaps, a visiting ticket of Arthur
O'Connor's, or a note from O'Coigly in acceptance of my invitation
to dinner.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p></div>

<p>On the other hand, it is stated in a letter to the Home
Office, dated July 24, 1799, that rebel despatches had been
regularly addressed to Mr. Lawless in the Temple, 'whose
fate,' it is added, 'is much lamented at Paris.'<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Lord Cloncurry
himself admits that in the autumn of 1797 he was
elected&mdash;but without his desire or knowledge&mdash;a member of
the Executive Directory of the United Irishmen, 'when, for the
first and only time, I attended a meeting held at Jackson's in
Church Street.'<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This date furnished fresh proof of the
promptitude and accuracy of Turner's information to Downshire
(supplied also in the autumn of 1797)&mdash;information
which revealed the adhesion of Lawless, afterwards Lord
Cloncurry, to the Executive Directory. Jackson's name is
also to be found in the list as dictated by Turner. Of course
Lawless must have been already a United Irishman, or he
could not be eligible for election to a seat in the Directory.
Binns, who was arrested with O'Connor and O'Coigly at Margate,
says: 'Coigly was no stranger to Lawless; he made him
a United Irishman in his father's house, in Merrion Street,
Dublin.'<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Cloncurry's Memoirs state merely that O'Coigly,
who was the finest-looking man he had ever seen, presented to
him a letter of introduction, descriptive of Orange persecution,
which it was alleged he had suffered.</p>

<p>Lawless and O'Coigly had opinions in common; and both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>were much together in London. The former never forgave
O'Connor for having&mdash;as he said&mdash;unfairly sacrificed O'Coigly
during the trials at Maidstone.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In collecting evidence to
hang the priest, renewed attention fell upon Lawless. His
first imprisonment lasted for six weeks. On April 14, 1799,
on the eve of his marriage with Miss Ryall, who at last died
of a 'broken heart,' he was again arrested on Portland's
warrant and committed to the Tower, where he remained two
years. Lord Cloncurry states that his father, in dread of
confiscation following his son, left away from him 65,000<em>l.</em>
However, the Irish rebel lived to become a British peer,
a Privy Councillor, and the adviser of successive Viceroys.
Dr. Madden, who received much help from Cloncurry when
compiling his 'Lives of the United Irishmen,' states that
Robert Emmet dined with this peer in Paris, previous to
leaving France on his ill-fated enterprise; and Madden, in his
second edition (ii. 137), says he knows not how to reconcile
the account of the interview, as supplied in 'Cloncurry's
Personal Memoirs,' with a verbal account of the same given
by his lordship to himself.</p>

<p>The list noted by Downshire from the dictation of his
visitor, though complete as regards the Rebel Executive of 1797,
far from embraced all the names which more careful thought
must have brought to the recollection of the informer. It had
now become second nature to him to discharge, almost daily,
letters of fatal aim, jeopardising the lives and reputations of
men who implicitly trusted him. He also, as it appears,
'opened a correspondence' with leading United Irishmen. It
is not sought to be conveyed that all the information came
from Turner; but the following remarks of Mr. Froude,
although they repeat a few names already mentioned, are
important, as connecting 'Lord Downshire's friend' with the
harvest of captures in midsummer 1798:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every day was bringing to the private knowledge of the Cabinet
how widely the mischief had spread, <em>as the correspondence which
continued with Lord Downshire's friend added to the list of accomplices</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Lord Cloncurry's son was no sooner arrested, than Stewart
of Acton, a young Agar, a young Tennent, young Curran, McGuckin,
Dowdall, and twenty others,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> whose names never came before the
public, were found to be as deeply compromised as he.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p></div>

<p>The question was even mooted as to whether he and others
should not be excepted by name from the Bill of Indemnity,
or even specially attainted by a Bill of Pains and Penalties,
in consideration of the impossibility of convicting them by
the ordinary course of the law.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Turner's knowledge and duties as a United Irishman
having been mainly confined to Ulster, it seemed strange
that one of the Northern Committee could be so intimate
with O'Connor and Lord Edward. Even in the betrayer's
first interview with Downshire he reveals much intimate
acquaintance with both. All this can be readily understood
now. In November, 1796, O'Connor took a house
near Belfast, preparatory to offering himself for the representation
of Antrim. Dr. Madden states that Lord
Edward and O'Connor lived together for some months, and
during their stay maintained friendly intercourse with the
Northern leaders.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Soon after we find the command in
Ulster assigned to O'Connor. 'Arthur O'Connor,' resumes
Mr. Froude, describing the events of December, 1797, 'after
spending a few months in the Castle,'<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> had been released
on bail, Thomas Addis Emmet and Lord Edward Fitzgerald
being his securities. <em>"The person" who had come to Lord
Downshire</em> had revealed the secret of the visit to Switzerland;
but without betraying his authority Camden could not again
order O'Connor's arrest.'<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> After an interval, however, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>at a critical moment, O'Connor was apprehended anew, and
he remained a State prisoner until 1802.</p>

<p>At an early stage of this chase I met with the seeming
difficulty that the name of Samuel Turner appears in the list
of leading rebels which '<em>the person</em>' gave to Lord Downshire.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
In undertaking to give a complete list of the Executive Committee,
he could not well omit his own name. No doubt to
invest it with increased importance, he puts it next after those
of Lord Edward and Arthur O'Connor (the nephew of Lord
Longueville), and before Stewart of Acton and the future
Lord Cloncurry. The act is consistent with the usual
swagger of the man, and shows the ingenuity by which he
hoped to baffle all subsequent evidence of his treachery.</p>

<p>Lord Camden writes: 'The intelligence with which we are
furnished would, if certain persons could be brought forward,
be sufficient to bring the conspiracy to light, defeat its ill
consequences, and make a salutary impression on the minds
of the people.'<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> 'Unfortunately,' comments Mr. Froude,
'"certain persons" declined to be brought forward. Pelham,
when in London, made <em>large offers to Lord Downshire's friend</em>,
but without effect.'</p>

(MSS. Dublin Castle). Lawless was to sail for London 'to-morrow night,' he
wrote, 'and ought to be watched every hour'; but nothing is said of the answer to
France, of which Pelham declares he was the bearer. McNally lived in Dublin,
was a United Irishman, and confidential lawyer of the body, but had been
bought over. The strange story of his life is told in a succeeding chapter.

dated, Dublin Castle, June 24, 1798, and given to me by Mr. Huband Smith,

the post of Adjutant-General for Armagh in the rebel army. Bentinck, writing
to General Nugent three days later, says that Stewart, when his prisoner, 'confessed
to me privately that he was a United Irishman.' This tends to show

<p><a name="Footnote_99_99" id="Footnote_99_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> McNally's secret letters, scores of which I have read in MS., make frequent
mention of Braughall as a man with whom he was intimate; and it is likely
that the news of Lawless's intended journey to England came from Braughall
innocently. McNally, while incriminating others, uniformly seeks to exculpate
Braughall, whose counsel he was (MS. letter of May 25, 1798). On June 13,
1798, he expresses his opinion that 'Braughall is an enemy to force'; and a
characteristic hint drops: 'If Braughall could be made a friend&mdash;and I do believe
he is not disinclined to be one, for I know he always reprobates tumult&mdash;his
influence is great, and his exertions would go far to restore peace.' Braughall had
been secretary to the Catholic Committee, and is repeatedly mentioned by Tone
in his Journal. A fine portrait of Braughall, in oils, may be seen in the boardroom
of the Royal Dublin Society, of which he was secretary. After his arrest,
this picture was relegated to a cellar of the institution; but, thanks to Lord J.
Butler, it has been recently unearthed and restored. He died in 1803.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_101_101" id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> He obtained the rank of Post-Captain, R.N., in 1784; and at the time
that he was with Lord Camden at Dublin Castle he commanded the 'Bravo'
gunboat. In 1805 he was gazetted 'Rear-Admiral of the Blue.' His name
crops up now and then in the Wellington Correspondence. Thus, on November
15, 1814, when the Bourbons had been restored, this gentleman, now signing
himself 'D'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, &amp;c.' writes from 'Bagatelle, Jersey,'
thanking his Grace for the condescending interest he had shown in recovering
for him the small sovereignty of Bouillon. <i lang="la">Vide</i> also a piquant memoir of His
Serene Highness Philip d'Auvergne, Prince de Bouillon, in <cite>Public Characters</cite>
for 1800-1, pp. 545, 561. His father, though of ancient lineage, embarked in
commercial pursuits; and it is added that at Jersey 'a multitude of spies were
kept in constant pay.' A love of epistolary intrigue seems to have been hereditary
with Captain d'Auvergne, Prince of Bouillon. History records that
Cardinal d'Auvergne Bouillon, 'during the War of the Succession, held a
culpable correspondence with the enemy, <em>i.e.</em> Marlborough, Orrery, and Galloway.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

THE MASK TORN OFF AT LAST</h2>


<p>Mr. Froude, quoting from the betrayer's letter to Downshire,
writes:&mdash;'I went to Harley Street, where Fitz<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> told me
of the conduct of the Catholics to him and his friends. He
said he would prevail on O'Connor, or some such,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> to go to
Paris; if not, he would go himself, in order to have Lewins
removed.'</p>

<p>Lord Edward came to this decision obviously on the
representations made by his false friend regarding Lewins.
The false friend will be found impugning Lewins on every
opportunity. Turner and Lewins, it may be repeated, clashed
as rival envoys; Lewins, a Catholic, represented the Leinster
Directory, while Turner claimed to represent the Northern.
Turner worked his pen and tongue to such purpose that he
at last succeeded in convincing Lord Edward of Lewins's
treachery. Binns, in his narrative, states that 'O'Coigly had
been commissioned by the Executive to supersede Lewins in
Paris, <cite>whom some suspected of betraying the interests of
Ireland</cite>.'<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The letter from Hamburg (first revealed by Mr. Froude)
continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. Matthieson<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> has just heard from Lady Lucy that O'Connor
is come. I supped last night with Valence, who mentioned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>having introduced Lord Edward<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and O'Connor to the Minister
here<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> in the summer before the French attempted to invade Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
They both went to Switzerland, whence O'Connor passed
into France, had an interview with Hoche, and everything was
planned.</p>

<p>I feared lest Government might not choose to ratify our contract,
and, being in their power, would give me my choice either to
come forward as an evidence or suffer martyrdom myself. Having
no taste for an exit of this sort, I set out and arrived here safe, and
now beg you will let me know if anything was wrong in my statements,
or if I have given offence....</p></div>

<p>One of the many unexplained letters in the Castlereagh
Correspondence finds its keynote here. In August, 1798,
Wickham, of the Home Office, writes as follows to Castlereagh,
who then held O'Connor a prisoner in Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Wickham's
object, though shrouded in mystery, was no doubt to check the
accuracy of 'Lord Downshire's friend,' and to weigh the marketable
value of his services:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It would be a great satisfaction to me, personally, were O'Connor
to be questioned on the object of his journey to Switzerland with
Lord Edward Fitzgerald in 1796, and whether they, or either of
them, were in France at that time, and what French agents they
saw besides M. Barth√©lemy. I was absent with the Austrian army
at the time of their arrival, so that I lost the opportunity of observing
their motions.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> If either of them went into France, which
I am persuaded they did, I should be curious, for very particular
reasons, to know whether they went in by way of Basle, and
whether their passports were given in their own names. Should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>there be no impropriety in questioning O'Connor on these points,
as I have said before, it would be a great satisfaction to me that it
should be done.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p></div>

<p>Fifty pages may be turned ere the answer to this letter
comes. It is headed '<em>Secret</em>,' and bears date 'Dublin Castle,
August 17, 1798.' All my circumstantial evidence, aiming
to show that Turner is the man whom Mr. Froude could not
identify, is crowned by this letter. Castlereagh thus replies
to Wickham:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Secret.                            'Dublin Castle: August 17, 1798.<br />
</p>

<p>'I have endeavoured to obey your commands in examining Mr.
O'Connor as to the object of his journey to Switzerland with Lord
Edward Fitzgerald. At first he declined answering to this point,
considering himself as only bound to state the facts which came to
his knowledge after he became a United Irishman, of which body
he was not then a member. Upon being pressed, without mentioning
names, he stated it thus:&mdash;In the summer of 1796, as set forth
in the Memoir, an agent was sent to France to arrange with the
Directory the plan of invasion. This person went to Hamburg;
from thence, accompanied by his friend, to Switzerland; neither
went to Paris, but the person employed <em>had an interview</em> near the
French frontier with a person high in the confidence of the Directory;
upon a communication with whom everything was settled.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
The reason neither proceeded to Paris was lest the English Government,
in whose pay most of the officers in Paris were supposed<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> to
be, should suspect the design, and arrest the persons on their
return.</p>

<p>'This perfectly agrees with Richardson's information, which
states that Lord Edward and O'Connor met Hoche, and arranged
the invasion. '<em>R&mdash;&mdash; states that O'Connor went into France</em>; if he
did, it was only a short distance merely to meet Hoche, and, from
what O'Connor said, Lord E. seemed to be the principal.'</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The above paragraph is one of much importance. Richardson
I have discovered to be another alias of the hydra-headed
Turner. Distinct proof of this will be found presently. Castlereagh
continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Should I succeed in drawing from him any further information
on this point, I shall have great pleasure in transmitting it. He
further stated that, when taken in Kent,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> although he had not
authorised any person to hire a vessel direct for France, but rather
looked to reach a Dutch port, yet his real object was to pass through
Switzerland into France, and fairly confessed that, had he reached
Paris, he should not have been idle, as, though not charged with
any special commission, he did believe the Directory would have
considered him as an accredited agent.'<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p></div>

<p>Ordinary students of history are not free to search the
papers of the Home Office, London after the date 1760; and
the present writer ventured to ask Mr. Lecky whether he had
met the name of Turner in his inquiries. The object of Mr.
Lecky's history is distinct from mine, and his researches have
taken a different direction; but he could not fail to observe,
he said, that the Government correspondence threw not much
light on questions of espionage, 'for names of informers,' he
adds, 'are nearly always concealed.' However, on referring to
his notes, it appeared that '<em>Richardson</em>' was the pseudonym
of Samuel Turner. While thanking my correspondent, I
thought it well to remind him that in the 'Castlereagh Papers'<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
'Furnes' is stated to be the alias for this man. And I added,
in order to guard against mistake, that one Thomas Richardson,
a Liberal magistrate for Tyrone, was confined, in 1797,
with Neilson and Teeling. The historian's reply is very satisfactory:<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
'Samuel Turner wrote his letters to the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Government under the name of Richardson. This,' adds
Mr. Lecky, 'is not a matter of inference, but of distinct
proof.'</p>

<p>Once only 'Richardson' is mentioned in 'Castlereagh.'
It was the false name by which the Home Office, when obliged
to communicate with Dublin Castle, masked Samuel Turner,
LL.D., of the Irish Bar. Lord Castlereagh's letter to the
Home Office confirms the intimate knowledge possessed by
Turner of the doings of O'Connor and Lord Edward Fitzgerald.
O'Connor was now&mdash;August, 1798&mdash;in an Irish
dungeon; and Lord Castlereagh having, as he says, pressed
him to answer certain questions, adds: '<em>This perfectly agrees
with Richardson's information, which states that Lord Edward
and O'Connor met Hoche and arranged the invasion.</em>'</p>

<p>Besides his horror of martyrdom by the knife, Turner had
a lively dread of the martyrdom of exposure and social
ostracism. Jackson's trial in 1794 had the effect of deterring
approvers. Curran's skill in torturing such persons was
marvellous; and Mr. Froude declares that he stretched
Cockayne as painfully as ever the rack-master of the Tower
stretched a Jesuit. 'He made him confess that he had been
employed by Pitt, and showed that, if Jackson was a traitor to
the State, Cockayne was a far blacker traitor to the friend who
trusted him.'<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>'Richardson' is now shown to be the same man as he who
gave his information to Downshire; and that 'Richardson'
was an assumed name for Samuel Turner.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Thus the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>of identity is established without appealing to further evidence.
But inasmuch as my efforts to track Turner open up facts long
forgotten, and others new to the historian, some readers may
not object to follow.</p>

<p>As regards Lord Edward's meeting with Hoche, more than
once referred to in Turner's letter to Lord Downshire and in
the correspondence of the Home Office, M. Guillon, a recent
investigator,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> could find no trace of it in the French official
archives. Special efforts were made at the time to veil
this historic interview. No wonder, therefore, that Mr.
Froude, in introducing the information furnished by Downshire's
mysterious visitor, points specially to the secret meeting
with Hoche, and how Hoche himself had not revealed it
even to Tone.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Wickham was but carrying out Portland's behest in signifying
to Castlereagh that O'Connor, then a prisoner, should
be questioned on points of which the Home Office had acquired
private knowledge. On August 23, 1798, the same polite
pumping of O'Connor is urged&mdash;a task fraught with no great
labour to a man of Castlereagh's tact and powers of persuasion.
'A <em>private</em> communication,' Wickham writes, 'of the
names of the persons with whom Mr. O'Connor corresponded
abroad, would answer <em>the particular purpose</em> required by the
Duke of Portland.' The 'particular' object is not explained.
It was probably that the spy might, as previously suggested,
cultivate epistolary relations with the men whom O'Connor<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
would admit to have been his correspondents.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Teeling, one of the Northern leaders, who had been closely
associated with Turner, gives a curious glimpse of the easy
intercourse which Castlereagh would maintain with his captives.
Sometimes he made the arrests himself in the first
instance, and afterwards could charm his prisoners by drawing
silken bonds around them. Teeling was accompanied by his
father on horseback, when 'we met,' he writes, 'Lord
Castlereagh, who accosted us with his usual courtesy. We had
proceeded up the street of Lisburn together, when, having
reached the house of his uncle, the Marquis of Hertford, we
were about to take leave of his lordship. "I regret," said he,
addressing my father, "that your son cannot accompany
you," conducting me at the same moment through the outer
gate, which, to my inexpressible astonishment, was instantly
closed, and I found myself surrounded by a military guard.'
Teeling, later on, describes a visit paid by Castlereagh to him
when a prisoner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fatigued, and apparently much dispirited, Lord Castlereagh
entered the room. He possessed the most fascinating manner and
engaging address, with a personal appearance peculiarly attractive,
and certainly not in character with the office he had that day
assumed. For though national pride was extinct in his soul, the
graces of nature were not effaced from the form, nor the polished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>manners of the gentleman forgotten in the uncourteous garb of the
officer of police. He regretted that in his absence I had been
subjected to the painful restraint of an additional guard. It was
not his desire that they should have been placed within my room.
A slight repast had been prepared for him, of which he pressed me
to partake. The wine was generous, his lordship was polite, and
the prisoner of State seemed for a moment forgotten in the kinder
feelings of the earlier friend. [Lord Castlereagh then informed
Teeling that they had that day arrested Neilson and Russell.]
'Russell!'<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> said I. 'Then the soul of honour is captive! Is Russell
a prisoner?' Lord Castlereagh was silent. He filled his glass&mdash;he
passed me the wine. Our conversation had become embarrassing....<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p></div>

developed by letters, a branch of composition in which Samuel Turner was <i lang="fr">au

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

DR. MACNEVIN'S MEMORIAL INTERCEPTED</h2>


<p>Although the spy did not confide to Lord Downshire
until October 1797 his name and secrets, there is reason to
believe that he had furnished information previously. To
enhance his importance he probably said nothing of this. As
Mr. Froude observes, he painted his own conduct in the colours
he thought best. This man had long played fast and loose.
So early as May 1797 Turner was viewed with suspicion.
The Castlereagh Papers contain a bundle of intercepted letters
addressed by Reinhard, the French Minister at Hamburg, to
De la Croix, head of the Foreign Office, Paris, of whom Tone
often speaks with affection.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> These letters, as already stated,
mention Turner under the name of Furnes, which we learn
from the Castlereagh Papers was an <em>alias</em> of Turner.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> He is
praised for his zeal and patriotism; but in one letter Reinhard
is found struggling with a painful misgiving. The suspicion is
so dark that he does not like to write even the name of
Furnes, but makes dots to tally with the letters composing it,
and no name was better known to De la Croix. At last
Reinhard tries to banish the thought as an unworthy suspicion;
and a subsequent letter of his reinstates Turner
in full prestige.</p>

<p>The letter which expresses suspicion bears date May 31,
but is confusingly assigned, in the Castlereagh Papers, to the
year 1798. Its reference to Hoche, however, shows that it
was written during the previous year&mdash;his death having
occurred on September 15, 1797.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>You must have heard [writes Reinhard to De la Croix] of the
apprehension of two committees of United Irishmen at Belfast, and
the publication of the papers seized, made by the secret committee
of the Parliament of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Among these papers is a letter from
the provincial committee, informing those of Belfast that the
executive committee having conducted itself in an improper manner,
the provincial committee thought fit to dissolve it, retaining however,
two-thirds of the former members. This letter has been
printed in London in the <cite>True Briton</cite>, a ministerial paper. It is
very remarkable that ...... should never have mentioned that
circumstance to me. Supposing, which is very probable, that this
reorganisation of the executive took place before the departure of ......
[from Ireland], it is natural enough to suppose that ......
should find himself among the <em>excluded members</em>. The opinion that I
have formed of him ...... [adds Reinhard in words worthy of a
true diplomat] is, that he is a man of haughty and violent character,
without, on that account, stooping to dissimulation and deceit; so,
in order to revenge himself on his countrymen, he may have betrayed
his cause to Mr. Pitt. [Reinhard goes on to say that] It was
letters of Lord Edward Fitzgerald which certified that this man
who called upon me was the person sent to me by Lady Fitzgerald
on his arrival.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></div>

<p>It seems needless to point out that this must be the
'person' whom Mr. Froude describes as being introduced by
Lady Edward Fitzgerald, and having the ear of Reinhard at
Hamburg; and there is hardly less doubt that the man thus
noticed was the same who, having got into debt with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>friends, addressed himself to Pelham as early as 1796. His
secret letter to Pelham will be seen presently. Meanwhile the
same sensitive pride and the same revengeful spirit when that
pride was once wounded is also traceable in the details
revealed to Lord Downshire next year. Judging from the
slippery and impulsive character of the man, I cannot doubt
that previous to his mission to London in October 1797, for
the purpose of making a final bargain with Pitt, he had
coquetted with Dublin Castle.</p>

<p>Lewins and Turner were rival envoys&mdash;Lewins represented
the Leinster Directory; Turner claimed to speak for Ulster.
Of Lewins, who stands above all suspicion, Reinhard writes
to De la Croix in 1797:&mdash;'I think L.... incapable of
treachery, but capable of imprudence. I should not answer
thus concerning <em>the other</em>. What seems further to concur in
the support of my hypothesis is, that Mr. L. before his departure
made it a point of great importance to ascertain whether
there was any other envoy from Ireland, who addressed himself
to me, and that he begged me not to give my confidence to
any other than to him alone. I refrained from giving these
tidings to General Hoche, not only because my means of
corresponding with him are uncertain, but because all the
letters from Frankfort announce his departure for Paris.'</p>

<p>It may not have struck Mr. Froude, as it certainly strikes
me, that the man he describes<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> as visiting Lord Downshire,
and at the last moment offering to betray, was the same
person whom the historian, one hundred pages previously,
notices as an informer, 'in the closest confidence of the <em>Northern
Leaders</em>, but whose name is still a mystery.'</p>

<p>It will be seen that Pelham's correspondent of 1796 had
fallen into debt and difficulties. This at first seems not consistent
with the statement of Mr. Froude that Downshire's
visitor was the son of a gentleman of good fortune in the
North. But it is easy to see that the son himself had got into
pecuniary straits. He tells Downshire of the expenses he is
under, and asks Pitt for a 'cool 500<em>l.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> to begin with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to a judgment debt of 1,500<em>l.</em> which Jacob
Turner in his will forgives his son Samuel,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> I find, on examining
the records of the three Law Courts, that another judgment
debt of 800<em>l.</em> was marked against Samuel Turner on January
26, 1793.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of informers, Mr. Froude writes under date
1796:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of these especially, whose name is still a mystery, was in
the closest confidence of the Belfast leaders. He had been among
the most enthusiastic of the original members of Tone's society, but
he had fallen into debt to others of the confederates and had been
expelled. In revenge he sold himself to the Government, satisfied
his creditors with money which he received from Pelham, and was
at once taken back into confidence. Among others, he became
an intimate associate of William Orr, a Belfast tradesman, afterwards
executed for treason, who at this time was a member of the
Head Northern Committee.</p>

<p>Orr told him that everything was ready. Dublin, Cork,
Limerick, were waiting only for orders to rise, and when the word
was given the movement was to be universal and simultaneous.
They had 200,000 men already officered in regiments; they had
pikes and muskets for 150,000, and more were on the way.</p>

<p>The militia were almost to a man United Irishmen, and in
fact, according to Orr, they would have risen in the autumn but for
some differences among themselves. For himself, the informer
thought that nothing would be attempted till the arrival of the
French.</p>

<p>The Belfast men, Neilson, Orr, the two Simms, the party who
had taken the oath with Wolfe Tone on Cave Hill,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> he described
'as wealthy, wily, avaricious, tenacious of their property, distrustful
of one another, and if afraid of nothing else, desperately afraid of
the Orangemen, who were five times stronger than people in general
believed.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> They had authentic news that Hoche might be expected
in the fall of the year, and then undoubtedly an effort would be
made. If Hoche came, they were perfectly confident that Ireland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>would be a republic before Christmas. The instant that the signal
was given the whole Orange party were to be assassinated....</p></div>

<p>The Informer concludes with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Be assured that what I have told you is true. The original
agitators have been kept concealed even from the knowledge of the
common people. The medium of dissemination has been the
priests, and they have concealed from their congregations, on whom
they have so effectively wrought, the names of those who have set
them on, merely saying that there were men of influence, fortune,
and power ready to come forward. The motive of the original
agitators&mdash;and I mean by them the members of the Catholic Committee
that sat in Dublin, and many of the Convention that were not
on the Committee&mdash;was to carry the Catholic Bill through Parliament
by the influence of terrorism.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p></div>

<p>So much for the informer who sought the ear of the Irish
Secretary in 1796. His close connection with the Northern
leaders, his air of mystery, his hatred of the priests and
the Catholic Committee, even his style and tone, the reference
to Hoche, the prediction that the Protestants would suffer
if the rebels won&mdash;all point to him as the same person who
made overtures to Pitt, through Downshire, in October
1797. The alleged disaffection of the militia and the danger
which menaced the estates of the aristocracy again crop up in
Turner's letter to Talleyrand.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In both cases the same stipulation
is made that he should not be called upon to give evidence
publicly&mdash;the same nervous temperament is revealed. Downshire's
visitor expressed mortal terror lest his life should pay
the forfeit of his startling whisper. The same fear&mdash;and I
believe I may add, presentiment&mdash;pervades the letter to
Pelham in 1796. 'Don't name it,' he writes; 'if it get out
they will know whence it came, and my life will be the certain
forfeit.'<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The 'secret' which the informer of '96 told Pelham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>was what Mr. Fronde describes as 'a curious story.' 'To
show you that they tell me their secrets,' writes the informer
to Pelham, 'here is the account told me of the death of Mr.
McMurdoch of <em>Lurgan</em>.'<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> From searches made in the Registry
of Deeds Office, Dublin, I find that Samuel Turner was closely
connected with Lurgan, and in a way which gave double
facilities for acquiring its secrets.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The reader might glance once more at Mr. Froude's account
of the visit to Lord Downshire on that dark October night in
1797. The betrayer's disguise and stealthy nervous gait as
though some avenging power were on his track, are things
worth noting. Why was he in such dread of assassination
before he unfolded his story to Downshire? Surely he must
have been conscious of having earned, for a long time before,
the penalty of 'Ormond steel.'<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> This, according to Dr.
Conlan's sworn testimony, was a specially familiar dogma with
Teeling and Turner when organising treason in Ulster. The
visit to Downshire was clearly prompted by greed. This peer
had got the name of having secret service money at his
disposal. 'Bank notes were offered to me,' observes James
Hope, the working weaver of Belfast, 'if I would implicate
Will Tennant, Robert Simms and others, and it was admitted
that the money came from Lord Downshire.' This was probably
among the efforts which were made to induce minor
conspirators to give evidence publicly against their leaders,
of whose treason the Crown had private knowledge through
Turner.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> McDougall's 'Sketches of Irish Political Characters,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>published in 1799, says of Lord Downshire (p. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>): 'His
political conduct agrees very well with his motto, <i lang="la">Ne tentes,
aut perfice</i>; he supports administration with all his might.'
Downshire's visitor knew, therefore, that this peer, if he liked,
could make good terms with Pitt. Much of the melodramatic
character of the scene appears to have been designed to move
Downshire. 'He saw Mr. Pitt' says Froude, 'who consented
that "the person's" services should be accepted.'</p>

<p>The Cabinet, we are told, was kept in ignorance of
his name. But Pelham, the Irish Secretary previous to
Castlereagh, seems to have known something of him already,
for, as we learn, 'Pelham, when in London, made large
offers to Lord Downshire's friend.'<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> That information had
been given by Downshire's visitor prior to the interview
of October 1797, I cannot doubt.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Mr. Froude, describing
Lord Edward's visit to Hoche on the Swiss frontier,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
writes: 'Hoche himself had not revealed it even to Tone,
but Lord Edward was known to be intimate with Macnevin.
He had been watched in London, and traced to the
lodgings of <cite>a suspected agent of the French Directory</cite>.' Downshire's
visitor, it will be remembered, had interviews with
Lord Edward in London.</p>

<p>When the betrayer threw back his disguise, Downshire, we
are told, recognised him at once. This, I suspect, was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>the first time that a communication reached Downshire from
the same source. Dr. Madden quotes from the 'Northern
Star' of September 16, 1796, a sensational account of the
arrest at Belfast of Russell, Neilson, Sampson, and many
others, and how the whole garrison, with its artillery, took
part in the stirring scene, and it appears that Downshire
helped to direct the proceedings. That day Neilson and
Russell surrendered to his lordship, and Tone in his 'Diary'
deplores the arrest as the heaviest blow which could fall on
their cause.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The name of the French agent in London is not mentioned
by Mr. Froude. It is M. J√§gerhorn, described by Reinhard,
the French Minister at Hamburg, as 'that estimable
Swede;' and concerning whom there is a mass of matter,
often purposely misleading, in the Castlereagh Correspondence.
Macnevin's memorial to the French Directory was
betrayed to England in the summer of 1797. M. J√§gerhorn
was sent by France to treat with the Irish Directory.
His mission, however, transpired, and means were taken to
prevent him going farther than London, whereupon Lord
Edward Fitzgerald was deputed to cross to England, and
there confer with J√§gerhorn.</p>

<p>Turner's <em>fracas</em> with the terrorist commander-in-chief,
Carhampton, was supposed to have caused his retirement to
Hamburg. But that scene, with its dialogue, may have been
purely theatrical.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>In June 1797 Turner attends several meetings of the Ulster
delegates in Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> There it was that the 'prudence or
the cowardice' of the Papist leaders in Dublin, as he says, disgusted
him.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Why should the notorious Turner be allowed to
go on to Dublin, and J√§gerhorn be refused?</p>

<p>Samuel Turner saw a good deal of Lord Edward and
J√§gerhorn in London. We find traces of this knowledge in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Mr. Froude's notes of 'the person's' interview with Downshire&mdash;how
he called Lord Edward 'Fitz' and had confidential
talk with him in Harley Street. The spy tells Downshire
soon after that Reinhard begged him to stay at Hamburg,
'as the only mode in which I could serve my country and the
republic. I instantly acquiesced, and told him I had arranged
matters with Lord Edward Fitzgerald in London for that
purpose.'</p>

<p>Turner played his cards so well, and personated an ardent
patriot so completely, that the suspicions of his fidelity which
Reinhard<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> expressed on May 31 are found removed soon
after. Dr. Macnevin, of Dublin, a chief in the Executive
Directory, was now coming to Paris to ask French aid.
Reinhard reports progress to De la Croix:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Hamburg: 25 Messidor [July 12].</p>

<p>While Mr. Lewins has suffered me to lose all traces of his journey,
and Mr. Furnes<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> is gone to write to him, M. J√§gerhorn has returned
from London, and a new Irish deputation has called upon me. All
the efforts of M. J√§gerhorn having failed against the obstinacy
with which the Duke of Portland refused him a passport for proceeding
to Dublin, he determined to call Lord Fitzgerald to London.
The latter came upon pretext of accommodating his sister. The
authenticity of the mission of Mr. Lewins was verified; important
details respecting the state of Ireland were given; it was ascertained
that there was no derangement in the plan, and in the resources of
the united patriots. It is unnecessary for me to give you a circumstantial
account of the information brought by Mr. F., since he enters
fully into that which Mr. Macnevin has just given. The latter came
surrounded by all the motives for confidence, and he did not leave
Dublin till the 27th of June: his intelligence is of the latest date, and
from the very source. The reports of Mr. Macnevin, who goes
here by the name of Williams, and who would wish to appear
always under that name, as Mr. Lewins under that of Thompson,
appear to me to throw great light upon all that the Government
can have an interest to know. Mr. Macnevin has been secretary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>of the executive committee, and all that he says proves him to be a
man thoroughly acquainted with the ensemble of facts and combinations.
In annexing to this despatch the Memorial<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> which he
delivered to me, I shall add what I have reason to think of importance
in his conference.</p>

<p>My first care was to clear up what the papers seized at Belfast
said concerning a change made by the provincial committee in
the organisation of the executive committee. It results from the
answers of Mr. Macnevin, conjointly with those of <em>Mr. Furnes, that
it was of dilatoriness and indecision that several members of the
committee were accused</em>; that the northern province, feeling its
oppression and its strength, was impatient to break forth,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> while
the committee strove to defer any explosion till the arrival of the
French, and declined giving a full explanation of its relations with
France; that, nevertheless, after the change of the committee,
meetings were held in Dublin and in the North, at which it was
resolved to wait; that the clandestine visitation of several dep√¥ts of
arms, where the powder was found damp and the muskets rusty,
contributed a good deal to that resolution; and that the desire for
the assistance of the French had in consequence become more
general than ever. It was, however, decided that a rising should
take place when the prisoners were set at liberty. Macnevin and
Lord Fitzgerald are of the moderate party. Furnes is for a speedy
explosion; and it is some imprudences into which his ardent character
has hurried him, that have obliged him to leave the country<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>;
whereas, the conduct of Mr. Macnevin has been so circumspect,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
that there is nothing to oppose his return.</p></div>

<p>Reinhard's despatch is continued at very great length, and
those who care to read it should consult the 'Castlereagh
Papers' (i. 282-6). He thus ends: 'I have just received a
memorial in which M. J√§gerhorn gives me an account of his
journey. I will send it to you by the next courier. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>estimable Swede has again manifested great devotedness to
the cause of liberty.'</p>

<p>By some marvellous sleight-of-hand J√§gerhorn's secret
report found its way to Whitehall, instead of to Paris, and
may be read in the memoirs of Lord Castlereagh.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Two years
later, the Swede will again be found tracked from Hamburg to
London, and arrested on Portland's warrant.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude's allusion to the facilities of command exercised
by 'the person' over Lady Fitzgerald's letter-bag, the hints
he gave Downshire how secret letters from Hamburg were
sealed and addressed, and how they might be intercepted,
read, and then passed on,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> are only those gleams of light that
shine dimly in dark places, but enough, with present knowledge,
to discern a good deal.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Downshire's visitor, in his
list of men marked out for doom, gave prominence to Dr.
Macnevin, 'a Physician who had great weight with the
Papists.' 'He (the betrayer) had discovered,' writes Froude,
'that the object of the Papists was the ruin and destruction of
the country, and the establishment of a tyranny worse than
that which was complained of.'</p>

<p>The famous memorial of Dr. Macnevin, embracing a full
report on the state of Ireland, and appealing to France for
help, was written at this time.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> On arrival at Hamburg
he entrusted it to Reinhard, the French minister there, by
whom&mdash;as we learn from the 'Cornwallis Papers'&mdash;it was
translated and forwarded to Paris. Mr. Froude thinks its
betrayal to the English Cabinet a very remarkable circumstance,
and the more strange because 'no suspicion has
been suggested of Macnevin's treachery.' A hidden hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>contrived to pass on to Pitt this document destined to become
historic.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Wickham, writing to Castlereagh on August 15, 1798, states
that the rebel executive committee directed Dr. Macnevin to
proceed to Paris by the way of Hamburg; that the principal
objects of his journey were to give additional weight and credit
to the mission of Lewins, and to confirm the information that
had already been transmitted.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Again the reader may be reminded
that Lewins and Turner were rival envoys. Each is
found constantly trying to circumvent the other. Turner,
therefore, had a special object in foiling and intercepting
Macnevin's memorial.</p>

<p>Reinhard, in the betrayed despatch of July 12, 1797, tells
De la Croix, at Paris, that every confidence might be reposed
in Lewins. Lewins' usual post was at Paris, just as Turner's
was at Hamburg, but both passed to and fro. Of Lewins,
Reinhard takes care to say that Macnevin</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>not only attested that he possesses, and deserves, the utmost confidence,
but that he is designated a minister at Paris in case of
success. Mr. Macnevin wished much that his memorial should be
communicated to him.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p></div>

<p>If it was Turner's interest to intercept Reinhard's letter
establishing confidence in Lewins, it was still more his interest
to keep back from Lewins a document which, while vindicating
his name, would protect it from further attack; and this the
'Memorial' of Macnevin was designed to do.</p>

<p>Camden had now ceased to be Viceroy and was succeeded
by Cornwallis.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The latter co-operates with the Home Secretary
in screening from publicity the name of their informer.
The report of the Secret Committee was now in progress.
Cornwallis, writing to Portland, says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The same reason may not operate against the production of Dr.
Macnevin's memoir, which might be supposed to have fallen into
our hands by various other means, and which, from its being produced,
without connection with the other papers, might not create
any alarm in the quarter where it is so necessary that the most
implicit confidence in our prudence and secrecy should be preserved.</p>

<p>Your Grace will of course be aware that no account will be
given, even to the Secret Committee, of the means by which these
papers came into the hands of Government.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p></div>

<p>Portland duly acknowledged Lord Cornwallis's despatch,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>in which you represent the advantages which might result from
laying before the Committees of Secrecy of the two Houses of
Parliament in Ireland the whole, or at least a part, of the very
secret and authentic documents relating to the conspiracy in that
kingdom, which I had the King's permission from time to time to
transmit to the late Lord-Lieutenant [Lord Camden]. I lost no
time in acquainting his Majesty's confidential servants with your
Excellency's sentiments upon this very important and delicate
question; and I am now to inform you that, after its having repeatedly
undergone the most serious investigation and discussion,
the result of our unanimous opinion is, that the communication of
the whole of those papers cannot on any account, or in any situation
of the country, be suffered to be made to a parliamentary committee,
under whatever qualification or conditions it may be appointed,
consistently with that secrecy which in certain cases the
honour and safety of the State require to be observed.</p>

<p>We agree, however, for the reasons you have stated, that the
same objection does not exist to the production of the greater part
of Dr. Macnevin's memoir, and I have therefore had an extract
made of such parts of it as it appears to us may be laid before the
public without inconvenience....</p>

<p>To prevent as much as possible any occasion being given which
can tend to a discovery of the channels by which this intelligence
has been obtained, I most earnestly recommend to your Excellency
to do your utmost in procuring that the facts which are stated from
it may not stand in the report of the committees in the exact order
in which they are given here, but that they may be mixed with
other information which has been derived from other sources.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The precautions taken to screen the betrayer were certainly
very complete. Castlereagh tells Wickham (July 30,
1798):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His Excellency authorised me to read the correspondence and
memorial once over to the committee of the Commons, with a
strict injunction that no person should note a single fact; and I
can truly state that the individuals on that committee are altogether
in the dark as to the manner in which that intelligence was obtained,
and, from the mode in which it was gone through, can only
have a very general impression of its contents. The same precaution
was used in the Lords; and, I trust, although the Duke of
Portland's despatch to his Excellency does not altogether sanction
what has been done, yet that his Grace and the Ministers, who
have so wisely enjoined the greatest precaution to be observed in
the use to be made of that most interesting and important correspondence,
will be of opinion that the guarded manner in which the
Lord-Lieutenant made the communication to the committees, not
authorising the smallest extracts to be made, or any of the facts to
be relied on in their report, without being fully authorised by his
Excellency, will preclude any danger to the State from this valuable
channel of intelligence being in any degree brought into suspicion.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p></div>

<p>In June 1798 Lord Edward was dead. The Sheares's had
been executed. Macnevin, O'Connor, T. Addis Emmet, and
Sampson lay in prison in Dublin. Blood flowed on every side.
The city was like a shambles. The State prisoners, on the
understanding that executions should cease, and that they
might be allowed to leave Ireland, consented to reveal, but
without implicating individuals, the scheme of the United Irishmen.
A prolonged secret inquisition by the Secret Committee
took place. As soon as their evidence appeared, Macnevin and
his fellow-prisoners complained, by a public advertisement, that
the Crown officials who drew up the report of the Secret
Committee had garbled the facts and distorted their evidence.
Into all this it is not necessary now to go, but it may be
observed that, while everything inconvenient was left out,
an innuendo was made that the betrayal of Dr. Macnevin's
memoir may have been due to Reinhard, the French Minister.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
This&mdash;apart from M. Mignet's testimony to the incorruptibility
of Reinhard&mdash;serves to exculpate him, and narrows the
spot on which suspicion now rests. Reinhard, in his letter to
De la Croix, thinks it strange that Turner had never spoken to
him about certain revelations made by 'the Secret Committee
of the Parliament of Ireland;'<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> but the reason now seems
intelligible enough.</p>

<p>Macnevin published his 'Pieces of Irish History'<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> at New
York in 1807, and notices the betrayal of the memorial which
he had addressed to the French Government. Up to that
time, and until his death in 1840, he does not seem to suspect
Turner. Had any such doubt occurred to him, he would have
been the first to avow it. At p. <a href="#Page_146">146</a> of his book Macnevin
inveighs against a 'profligate informer,' 'a ruffian of the name
of Reynolds;' but Reynolds' treachery was confined to the
arrests at Bond's in Dublin, and did not take place until March
1798. Ten pages further on Macnevin speaks of the 'unparalleled
fidelity of the United Irish Body.' Dr. Macnevin
was struck by the knowledge the Government had acquired of
the 'negotiations of the United Irishmen with foreign States,'
and, he adds, 'at this time one of the deputies [<em>i.e.</em> himself]
had personal evidence of its extent and accuracy. That knowledge
was obtained from some person in the pay of England
and in the confidence of France.' And Dr. Macnevin then
proceeds to point to <span class="smcap">Reinhard</span> by name!</p>

<p>This is just what the officials of the Home Office wished
for all along. Wickham, referring to the publication of
Macnevin's memorial by the Secret Committee of the House
of Lords, writes: 'It may fairly be presumed that the copy
has been obtained at [the Foreign Office] Paris, or from R.'s
[Reinhard's] secretary at Hamburg. <em>This conjecture will be at
least as probable as the real one.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>One circumstance struck Macnevin as 'confirmation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>strong' of his dark suspicion. Reinhard, as he tells us,
made difficulties about giving him a passport to Paris. A
most important despatch from Reinhard to De la Croix thus
concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What I must particularly urge, Citizen Minister, in regard to
this business, is, at least, that you will have the goodness to direct
me as to Mr. Macnevin. I will not give another passport without
your order.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p></div>

<p>This letter&mdash;possibly written at Lady Edward Fitzgerald's
house at Hamburg, and put into her post-bag&mdash;was treacherously
betrayed to Pitt. When De la Croix remained ominously
silent in response to the above appeal, is it surprising that
Reinhard should have made difficulties and delays in giving
Macnevin a passport?<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Macnevin's groundless distrust of Reinhard naturally influenced
the views of a most painstaking investigator. Dr.
Madden, who, when he at last saw, in the 'Castlereagh
Papers,' Reinhard's letters to De la Croix, regarded the circumstance
as damning proof of his treachery.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Subsequently
Mignet, the great French historian and keeper of the ministerial
archives at Paris, who had ample official means of
knowing the character and acts of both Reinhard and De la
Croix, assured Madden in writing that both men were incorruptible.
This may be taken as conclusive, for, unlike
Turner, there is not a line in any English State Paper
tending to compromise Reinhard or De la Croix.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>For the act of betrayal we must therefore look to Samuel
Turner, agent at Hamburg of the United Irish Brotherhood;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>the man who had access to the most secret papers in Lady
Fitzgerald's house, and who, we learn, 'was admitted to close
and secret conversations upon the prospect of French interference
in Ireland with Reinhard.' This, in fact, was the
grand proof submitted by Downshire's visitor to show that he
was in a position to spy to advantage&mdash;a fact sufficient in
itself to demonstrate that Reinhard was himself no spy.</p>

<p>Dr. Madden's suspicion of Reinhard was doubtless strengthened
by a passage which for a long time puzzled myself, and
occurs in Wickham's letter to Castlereagh of June 8, 1798.
Wickham speaks of 'information confirmed by a person at
Hamburg, who must necessarily have derived his intelligence
from a very different source, and who could not but be
ignorant of that from which R. had procured all that he has
communicated to us.' The name thus masked is not Reinhard,
but Richardson&mdash;an alias for Turner, as proved at p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>
<i lang="la">ante</i>.</p>

<p>One thing greatly complicated this puzzle as regards 'R.'
Wickham, in a subsequent letter, dated July 25, 1798, speaks
of 'R.'&mdash;meaning not Richardson, but Reinhard, as the context
shows.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> But these blanks are due to the noble editor of
the 'Castlereagh Papers,' the late Lord Londonderry; and
in cloaking the name Richardson&mdash;it inadvertently
peeps out in one place, like 'Capel' instead of 'Catesby' in
'Lothair'&mdash;he doubtless thought that it was a real name.</p>

<p>On February 18, 1798, Lord Moira addressed the House
of Lords in favour of Catholic Emancipation, which, he declared,
must be granted, as well as Parliamentary Reform.
'The greatest evil to be feared from it sinks to nothing compared
to the mischief which is raging at present. The expression
of a conciliatory desire on your part would suspend
immediately the agitation of the public mind.'</p>

<p>Mr. Froude says that the members of Council knew more
than Lord Moira&mdash;'if he really believed his words;' and he
adds that they must have found it hard 'to sit patient
under his flatulent declamation.' How much Turner's tattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
had excited the Cabinet, and aroused lasting prejudice against
a statesman not less able than estimable, appears from the
historian's words: 'At that moment the Council were weighing
intelligence from the friend at Hamburg, so serious that
they had all but resolved on an immediate arrest of the entire
Revolutionary Committee.'</p>

<p>Reinhard tells De la Croix, on July 12, 1797, that while
'Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Macnevin<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> were of the moderate
party, Turner was for a speedy explosion.'<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Turner was
co-operating in a very base policy, one which unscrupulous
statesmen are said to have planned. During the examination
of Macnevin before the Secret Committee, Lord Castlereagh
confessed that 'means were taken to make the United Irish
system explode.' The policy of exciting a premature explosion
before Ireland had been organised peeps forth in the Report of
the Secret Committee of the Irish Parliament: 'The rebellion
[we are told] would not have broken out so soon as it did, had
it not been for the well-timed measures adopted by Government.'</p>

<p>Turner's policy changed according as the policy of his
employers changed. In March 1798 the rebel Directory at
Dublin were seized as they sat in council at Oliver Bond's.
Soon after, three out of thirty-two counties rose; and to
crush that partial revolt cost England twenty-two millions
of pounds and twenty thousand men.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_158_158" id="Footnote_158_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> There were informers from the first, but not to the extent suggested; nor
can it be fairly said that they were men 'deepest in the secret.' 'This and
similar information,' writes Mr. Froude, 'came in to them (the Government) from
a hundred quarters' (p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a>). 'They had an army of informers' (p. <a href="#Page_174">174</a>). The
historian here writes of the year '96, and rather overrates the extent of the
treachery. Dr. Macnevin, writing in 1807, says that the secrets of the United
Irishmen were kept with wonderful fidelity. Their society existed from 1791;
it was not until 1798, when ropes were round their necks, that Reynolds and
McGuckin proved false; and the same remark applies to most of the others.</p></div>

Mr. Froude mistake, for two distinct betrayers, the one Informer? His striking
scenes, his dramatic situations, his fine painting and accessories, remind me
of a stage where the movements of a few men convey the idea of an advancing
'army.' That 'Downshire's friend' had been previously known as an informer
is proved by a letter from the Viceroy Camden to Portland, dated December 9,
1797.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

GENERAL NAPPER TANDY</h2>


<p>An old and very influential French newspaper, 'Le Journal
des D√©bats,' published, on February 29, 1884, an article
descriptive of the pleasure with which its writer had heard
sung a touching but simple Irish lyric, 'La Cocarde Verte,'
commemorative of the career of General Napper Tandy. It
had been sung, he said, at Paris, by an English girl, who
threw into its simple lines a power most entrancing. The
melody and the words continued to haunt him at all hours,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
and, some months later, we learn, found him in London,
seeking information, but in vain, regarding Napper Tandy
and the song. During a subsequent tour to the 'Giant's
Causeway,' his inquiries were not much more successful.
'J'avouai que nos histoires de France ne nous parlent pas de
Napper Tandy, et je quittai Portrush sans √™tre absolument
satisfait.'</p>

<p>When French history is silent as regards Tandy, and
remote inquirers appear so much interested about him, the
present chapter may not have been written in vain.</p>

<p>The arrest by British agencies of Tandy and others within
the neutral territory of Hamburg and contrary to the law of
nations was baldly denied for some time.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> A similar tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>was taken by official authority as regards the subsequent
surrender of Tandy to England; but how true was the story,
and with what striking circumstances fraught, will presently
appear.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of Humbert's expedition for
Ireland, Tandy, now a general in the French service, accompanied
by a large staff, including Corbet and Blackwell, sailed
from Dunkirk in the French ship 'Anacreon,' having on board
a store of ordnance, arms, ammunition, saddles, and accoutrements.
He effected a landing on the coast of Donegal, but,
learning that Humbert, after having beaten Lake at Castlebar,
had met with reverses and surrendered to Cornwallis, he
abandoned the enterprise and re-embarked. It is told in the
'Castlereagh Papers' that the 'Anacreon,' when attacked by
an English cruiser, gave battle near the Orkneys, and that
'Tandy had put two twelve-pound shot in his pockets, previous
to leaping overboard in the event of striking to the English
ship.'<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>An interesting memoir of Colonel Blackwell, who died in
1809, appears in Walter Cox's 'Irish Magazine' for that year.
William Murphy, an old '98 man, and afterwards the well-known
millionaire, said that Cox played fast and loose,
betraying his own party and the Government alternately.
Cox begins by saying that 'few occurrences excited a stronger
or more universal sensation than the treacherous arrest at
Hamburg, in 1798, of Blackwell, Morres, Tandy and Corbet.'
Cox describes Blackwell's perilous descent with Tandy on the
Irish coast, and states that, when passing through Hamburg
going back to France, the secret of his arrival and that of his
comrades 'was betrayed to the British envoy, Crawford, by
two pensioned spies of England, <em>Turner</em> and Duckett.'<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Cox was a shrewd man; but when suspicion is once raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>it is apt to extend beyond due limits. He was right as
regards Turner; he wronged Duckett. His impression of at
least the first was probably derived from Blackwell himself,
for Cox acknowledges that some of the facts 'the writer of this
sketch received from the mouth of Colonel Blackwell.'</p>

<p>General Corbet privately printed at Paris, in 1807,
strictures on the conduct of the Senate of Hamburg for having
handed him over to the British minister. Appended to this
<em>brochure</em> is a letter written by Tandy some days before his
death, giving an account of his arrest. 'The original,' writes
Corbet, 'is in my possession.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I arrived in Hamburg on the evening of the 22nd of November,
1798 [writes Tandy], and the next day I went with M. Corbet to visit
the French minister and the Consul General Lagan to obtain passports
to Paris. I passed the day with the consul general and prepared
for my departure, which was to have taken place the following day.
I was invited to sup the same evening by Messrs. T&mdash;&mdash; and D&mdash;&mdash;,
in a house where Blackwell, Corbet, and Morres supped also; we
remained there till midnight, and at four o'clock went to our hotel.
Towards morning I was awakened by armed men rushing into my
chamber.</p></div>

<p>Cox jumped at the conclusion that the names thus
cautiously initialled by Corbet, are Turner and Duckett.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> A
coming chapter will vindicate Duckett; and I am bound to
conclude that this man, if he really joined the supper party,
had been duped by the plausibility of Turner. Turner and
Duckett have been previously shown as on friendly terms.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The accuracy of the information by which Crawford, the
British minister at Hamburg, was able to effect his <em>coup</em>
excited general surprise. According to the 'Castlereagh Papers'
tidings reached him that Tandy and others were lodged at an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>inn in Hamburg called the 'American Arms,' and on November
24, 1798, soon after five o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, this minister, accompanied
by a guard, entered the house. Early as it was,
Napper Tandy was found writing. The officer demanded his
passport. Thereupon Tandy, with composure, said he would
produce it, and going to his trunk he took out a pistol, which
presenting, he said: 'This is my passport.' The officer
grappled with him, and the guard rushing in secured Tandy.
'He and his associates were put in irons, and confined by
order of Sir James Crawford.'<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>And now for a short digression ere finishing the story of
Tandy's woes.</p>

<p>People were puzzled to know how the complicated intrigue
which achieved his capture&mdash;contrary to the law of nations&mdash;could
have been completed in a few hours. There can be
little doubt that Turner&mdash;whom Cox broadly charges with
the betrayal, by furnishing information to Crawford had
ample notice of their coming.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Besides Turner's personal
acquaintance with Tandy, official ties of brotherhood had
arisen between them, and nothing was more natural than the
invitation to sup.</p>

<p>A letter headed 'Secret Information from Hamburg,' and
bearing date August 16, 1798, has found its way into Lord
Castlereagh's correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The writer, clearly Turner,
is found back at Hamburg after one of his periodic visits to
Paris, where, with his usual <em>audace</em>, he claimed to be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>accredited envoy of the United Irishmen, and sought to discredit
the mission of Lewins.</p>

<p>Before Tandy had left Paris for Dunkirk, where the
'Anacreon' was being equipped for Ireland, he had some
unpleasant differences with Lewins and Wolfe Tone.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> This
afforded prospect of a golden harvest for our spy. Tone had
long avoided Turner; Lewins repudiated his pretensions.
Our spy now 'sided' with Tandy's party, and intrigued to
such purpose that he seems to have got himself appointed
<i lang="la">locum tenens</i> of the general. In this affair Muir and Madgett,
with honest motives, bore a part. Muir, a distinguished
Scotch advocate, had attached himself to the republican
interest, and was tried for sedition.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Madgett&mdash;an old Irish
refugee&mdash;held a post in the Foreign Office in Paris, and will
be remembered by readers of Tone's Diary as in constant
communication with him. It is needless to quote in full the
anonymous letter of our spy. It will be found in the 'Castlereagh
Papers,' vol. i. pp. <a href="#Page_306">306</a>-9. The men noticed in it,
McMahon and O'Coigly, McCann and Lowry, had been
old allies of Turner's; and 'Casey, brother to the priest,'
Tone, Tandy, Lewins, Teeling, Orr of Derry, McCormack,
all figure in the original information conveyed to Lord Downshire.</p>

<p>The letter begins by saying that 'Tandy, having quarrelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>with Lewins and Tone, called a meeting of United Irishmen,
at which a division took place; the numbers pretty equal.'
Tandy's rupture with Lewins was quite enough to make
Turner take Tandy's side. Dating from Hamburg, and
believing that the real 'minister of the interior' was a good
cook, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A General Creevy, who goes with the great expedition [to Ireland],
called on me one day at Paris and stayed dinner. Muir and
Madgett were of the party. It was for the purpose of inquiring
into Tone's character, which we gave him. Madgett and Muir swore
me into the Secret Committee for managing the affairs of Ireland
and Scotland in Tandy's place: there are only we three of the
committee.</p></div>

<p>He then proceeds to describe his visit to the Hague, and
the information he acquired there. It may be asked if any
evidence exists that Samuel Turner left his usual quarters at
Hamburg and was in Paris at this time, and afterwards at the
Hague. On p. 409 of the same volume of Castlereagh, Turner
is described by name as in Paris on business connected with
the United Irishmen, and that from thence he repaired to the
Hague. Here he was consulted, as he stated, by General Joubert
on various points, including the 'safest places for debarkation.'
The West coast, he tells Wickham, 'seemed to be the most
eligible, from Derry to Galway.' In the letter to Talleyrand<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
the West coast is also suggested as the best point to invade.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
The spy, after alluding to the 'contrivances of Lewins,' who
'strives to prevent any person doing anything with the (French)
Government but himself,' reports Duckett as a most active
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>rebel. He makes this statement in a paper meant for the
private perusal of Portland<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and Wickham. Thus it would
appear that Blackwell and Cox wronged Duckett in accusing
him of informing against Tandy. To Duckett, a man hitherto
maligned, it is necessary in justice to return.</p>

<p>Lord Edward had died in Newgate June 4, 1798. The
departure of his widow from Dublin and return to Hamburg
are announced in the 'Evening Post' of August 16, ensuing.
Our spy, as the 'friend' of the dead Geraldine, welcoming
Pamela back and tendering sympathy and consolation, would
be a good subject for a picture. Mr. Froude tells us that the
great power wielded by this seeming exile of Erin lay in his
intimacy with Lady Edward Fitzgerald at Hamburg. Morres
had been sojourning here previous to Tandy's arrival, and,
like Turner, received hospitality at her hands. 'Lord Downshire's
friend,' who we are told had access to her house
and post-bag, could not fail to know Morres well. It will be
remembered that Dr. Madden blows hot and cold on Reinhard,
the French minister at Hamburg, and suggests that he
may have betrayed to Pitt his correspondence with De la
Croix; but Reinhard had now been succeeded by a new man;
and if further exculpation<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> of Reinhard were needed after the
testimony of Mignet, it is found in the fact that the correspondence
of his successor was also tampered with. The letter
of 'Lord Downshire's friend,' in which he proposes to become
a spy, mentions, as a striking proof of his power, that
he had full access to the <em>bureau</em> of the French resident at
Hamburg: M. Maragan now filled this post. A letter
addressed by him to Talleyrand may be found in the 'Castlereagh
Papers.'</p>

Hamburg. He was an intimate friend of the late Lord E. Fitzgerald's;
he has, therefore, acquired a right to the kindness of the
widow, and it is on this ground alone that she has allowed herself
to express it. Mr. Morres was the leader of the numerous corps of
United Irishmen: he is utterly ruined in consequence of his attachment
to the cause of liberty. He wishes to go to France, where he
has important matters to communicate. He is expecting from day
to day an officer, who has commanded some expedition, and he
hopes to make the journey with him.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p></div>

<p>This was Tandy, as a succeeding letter explains. Tandy
and Morres were seized at the same moment, and doubtless on
the same whisper. Hamburg encouraged an impression that
Russia prompted this arrest; but, unless on the hypothesis
that Pitt had the Senate of Hamburg in his pay, it is hard to
understand how orders were sent to effect arrests there, just as
if it were on British territory. Mr. Secretary Elliot was a
member of the family which some months previously received
the peerage of Minto in acknowledgment of diplomatic service.
This official, writing to Lord Castlereagh, says: 'I learn from
Mr. Hammond, Canning's colleague [in the Foreign Office],
that Napper Tandy is suspected to be at Hamburg, and
instructions have been sent to our resident there to apprehend
him.'<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Thus Crawford must have heard in advance
of Tandy's coming, and taken his steps accordingly. Of
course he at once acquainted the head of his department; and
hence the remark of Mr. Elliot.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Some historians convey that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Tandy, after his ill-fated expedition to Ireland, returned direct
from Donegal to Hamburg, <i lang="fr">en route</i> for France. The words
of the editor of the 'Cornwallis Papers' are that 'he returned
<em>immediately to France</em>.' But these accounts are most
misleading. Tandy did not get back to France until after his
liberation in 1802, and instead of the few days which might
be supposed to intervene between the departure from Donegal
and arrival at Hamburg, it was nearer to two months. Dreading
renewed trouble with the English cruisers, Tandy gave
orders to steer for Norway. All landed at Bergen, and after
suffering many vicissitudes sought to reach France by land.
The cold became so intense that, as Corbet notes, people
were found frozen to death at the gate of Hamburg. Weary
and footsore, Tandy arrived here at twilight on November 22,
1798. Hungry for Irish news, he readily embraced Turner's
invitation to sup.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>This meeting between Tandy and the man whose 'wearing
of the Green'<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> had forced to fly his native land may have been

which, a century later, so excited the querist in the 'Journal

</div>
<p>It was no isolated secret that Turner had acquired and
disclosed. General Corbet, speaking of Morres, Tandy and
Blackwall, gives an interesting account of their subsequent
imprisonment at Hamburg, and how successive plans to effect
their escape became marvellously foiled. 'I lost myself in
vain conjectures,' he writes. 'It was not until a long time
after that I learned the infamous treason of which I was the
victim. I was very far from suspecting the author.' And then,
in a foot-note, he indicates him with great caution, dreading
the penalty of an action for libel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A man [he writes] residing at Hamburg, who had all my confidence,
and that of my three companions in misfortune, was at this
precise time sold to England, and was one of Crawford's numerous
agents. He was informed of all our projects, and communicated
them to this minister. This man is now [1807] actually in London,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
and pensioned by the Government.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p></div>

<p>It is strange that Corbet was able to anticipate by half a
century the revelation made in the 'Cornwallis Papers,' that a
secret pension had been given to Turner for information in
Ninety-eight. But his privately printed <em>brochure</em> may indeed
be styled a sealed book.</p>

<p>Some hours after the arrest Maragan, the French resident,
wrote to the Senate at Hamburg claiming Tandy and his
colleagues as French citizens, and threatening to leave the
Hague unless they were released. Crawford opposed the
demand in terms equally strong, and, needless to say, carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>his point. The French <i lang="fr">charg√© d'affaires</i>, observing Tandy's
critical state of health, offered a large sum to the officer of the
guard to permit his escape, but the superior influence of
Crawford overrode all obstacles.</p>

<p>The letter of Tandy, from which an extract has already
been made, states that after his arrest one hundred louis d'or
were taken from him and never returned. His sufferings in
prison he describes as so severe that life became well nigh
insupportable, and more than once he prayed to be led out on
the ramparts and shot.</p>

<p>John Philpot Curran gives us some idea of what these
sufferings were:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was confined in a dungeon little larger than a grave; he
was loaded with irons; he was chained by an iron that communicated
from his arm to his leg, and that so short as to grind into
his flesh. Food was cut into shapeless lumps, and flung to him by
his keepers as he lay on the ground, as if he had been a beast; he
had no bed to lie on, not even straw to coil himself up in if he could
have slept.</p></div>

<p>The details given by Corbet of their detention are hardly
less painful. At last he and Morres were removed to a new
prison.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What had happened to me [he writes] would have naturally
discouraged and prevented me from making any new attempts;
nevertheless, I managed to correspond with my two companions in
misfortune; and we all three stood so well with our guards, the
greater number of whom we had gained, that we resolved to arm
ourselves and place ourselves at their head, to deliver Tandy, who
was in another prison, and after to repair to the house of the French
ambassador. Our measures were so well taken that we hoped this
time at least to recover our liberty in spite of the impediments
which fortune might put in our way. But <em>the same traitor</em> who
had formerly deranged my plan discovered all to the English
minister, Crawford, who immediately gave orders that our guards
should be changed, and even that those of the different posts of
Hamburg should be doubled, which continued even to our departure.
Such was the result of the last struggle we made to
obtain our liberty at Hamburg.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>These incidents occurred at a time when wagers had been
laid that the days of French power were numbered. England,
Austria and Russia prepared to form an alliance. Suvarov,
repulsing the French arms in Italy, had entered on French
territory; the Archduke Charles advanced on the Rhine, and
the Duke of York was in full march on Amsterdam. Hamburg
felt that the time had come when England might be truckled
to, and France slighted. At midnight on September 29, 1799,
after ten months' detention, Tandy and his companions were
torn from the sanctuary they had sought and put on board
an English frigate which had cast anchor at Cuxhaven.</p>

<p>Their departure was marked by a curious incident, which
General Corbet thus notices in describing his arrest and extradition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In open sea, and half a league before us, an English frigate laden
with gold, and on the way to Hamburg, was suddenly wrecked and
only one sailor saved. What was the use of this? Was it to purchase
additional mercenaries against France? Was it the price of
that treachery of which the Hamburghers were just guilty? Happy
would the Continent be if all the gold leaving England for such
purposes had been buried in the sea!<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></div>

<p>Corbet, describing his arrest in the first instance, says
that he asked the soldiers by what authority they acted.
'They appeared not to be ignorant that we were French officers;
they answered that they should fulfil the orders of the minister
of England.'<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>For a time France sought to stifle its wrath; but at last
it was resolved that the conduct of Hamburg should be denounced
to all States, allied and neutral; that all French
consular officers quit the offending territory; and that every
agent of Hamburg residing in France should leave in twenty-four
hours. The Senate of Hamburg now became penitential,
and wrote to say so. 'Your letter, gentlemen,' replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Napoleon, 'does not justify you. You have violated the
laws of hospitality, a thing which never happened among
the most savage hordes of the desert.'</p>

<p>A deputation from the Senate arrived at the Tuileries to
make public apology to Napoleon. He again testified his
indignation, and when the envoys pleaded national weakness
he said: 'Well, and had you not the resource of weak states:
was it not in your power to let them escape?' In reply it was
urged that such negligence would have irritated rather than
appeased the Powers. Napoleon laid a fine of four millions
and a half on Hamburg. This sum, it is na√Øvely remarked
by Bourrienne, his secretary, mollified him considerably, and
helped to pay Josephine's debts.</p>

<p>An interesting account of the arrival in England of Tandy
and his companions appears in the 'Courier,' a leading London
paper, of October 31, 1799.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> A military <em>cort√®ge</em> accompanied
them from Sittingbourne to Rochester, and thence over Blackfriars
Bridge, up Ludgate Hill, to Newgate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Had Buonaparte and his staff been sent here by Sir Sydney
Smith, they could not have excited more curiosity [records the
'Courier']. A vast concourse of people was gathered at the landing
place, who attended the prisoners and their escort to the garrison
gates, where a new concourse was assembled, and so from stage to
stage to the end of the journey, everybody, old and young, male and
female, was anxious to get a peep at this wonderful man, now
become, from the happy perseverance of Ministers, a new bone of
contention among the powers of Europe.</p>

<p>Napper Tandy is a large big-boned muscular man, but much
broken and emaciated. His hair is quite white from age, cut close
behind into his neck, and he appears much enervated. This is
indeed very natural, if it be considered that he is near seventy years
of age, and has just suffered a long and rigorous confinement, his
mind the constant prey of the most painful suspense. He wore a
large friar's hat, a long silk black grey coat, and military boots,
which had a very <em>outr√©</em> effect.</p>

<p>Blackwell and Morres seem to be about five and thirty. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>are two tall handsome-looking men, wore military dresses, and have
a very soldierlike appearance. The former is a man of a very enterprising
genius, about the middle size, apparently not more than
four or five and twenty, and has much the look of a foreigner.</p></div>

<p>Morres had not accompanied Tandy in his expedition to
Ireland; and it may be asked on what grounds he was placed
in irons, and made to share with the ill-starred general all
the rigours of a tedious imprisonment. While Morres indignantly
protested against this persecution, he little thought
that a document, seriously compromising him, and penned by
his own hand, had been given up to the Crown officials. This
was a memorial which, on his arrival at Hamburg as an Irish
refugee, he had written, in Lady Edward's house most probably,
and addressed to the French Minister at Paris. It was intercepted
as usual, and may now be consulted in the 'Castlereagh
Papers.' Colonel Hervey Montmorency Morres tells Bruix
how he had been intrusted by Lord Edward with the direction
of the intended attack upon Dublin, and especially as regarded
the magazine and batteries in the Ph≈ìnix Park; how after
the death of Lord Edward he escaped from Dublin, and remained
concealed until the arrival of Humbert at Killala,
when he assembled the men of West Meath to aid the invading
army; but upon the surrender of Humbert he disbanded his
followers, and, being pursued by the King's troops, made his
way to England, and thence to Hamburg on October 7, 1798.
In conclusion he implored the protection of France for himself
and his family.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>After Tandy and Morres had been removed to Ireland,
they were placed at the bar of the King's Bench, when the
Attorney General prayed that sentence of death should be
passed upon them. Historians curtly tell that the prosecution
broke down on a point of law; but this explanation does not
quite satisfy. The prisoners pleaded that they were arrested
abroad by the King's command, and were thereby prevented
from surrendering themselves for trial before the day limited
by the Act of Attainder for doing so. The case was argued for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
days. Tandy's legal position was shown to be this: 'Why did
you not surrender and become amenable to justice? Because
I was in chains. Why did you not come over to Ireland?
Because I was a prisoner in Hamburg. Why did you not do
something tantamount to a surrender? Because I was unpractised
in the language of the strangers, who could not be
my protectors, inasmuch as they were also my fellow-sufferers.'
Counsel argued that when the Crown seized Tandy at Hamburg
it thereby made him amenable, and so satisfied the law. Lord
Kilwarden, a most humane judge, ruled that Tandy should be
discharged.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> But their triumph was short-lived. Tandy was
transferred to Lifford, Donegal, previous to being tried in the
district where two years before he had made a hostile descent
from France. In Lifford gaol Tandy lay for seven months,
during which time great efforts were made to ensure the conviction
of so formidable a character; and April 7, 1801, was
at last fixed for his trial. Several applications to postpone it
were refused by the court, and divers law arguments and
objections overruled.</p>

<p>The compact with Turner that he should never be asked
to brave public odium by appearing as an approver, was of
course respected; but it would seem that he was now brought
over to Ireland for the purpose of assisting the law officers in
their difficult and delicate task. That the quondam spy at
Hamburg was in Ireland at this very time, though soon after
he is back again in Hamburg, can be shown. The Registry of
Deeds Office, Dublin, records that on February 25, 1801,
Samuel Turner, vaguely described as 'of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain,' executed to George Lysaght a conveyance of
lands in Clare. In society he was well trusted, unless by a
few who kept their thoughts to themselves; and at this same
time also he became the trustee of the marriage settlement of
John Wolcot<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and Dorothy Mary Lyons. One can hardly
realise this man, whose more fitting post would be a funeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>feast, presiding at a bridal breakfast and wishing joy and long
life to his friends. His trip to Ireland 'killed two birds with
one stone,' for the Book of Secret Service Money expenditure
reveals that on July 8, 1801, 71<em>l.</em> 13<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> is paid 'per <em>Mr.
Turner</em> to Chapman in Cork for one year and eleven weeks, at
one guinea.' Chapman I suspect to have been a minor agent
employed by Turner to ferret out evidence against Morres
and the Corbets (both Cork men), and in connection with the
prosecution of Tandy.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The 'one year and eleven weeks'
would cover the time that Tandy and his companions, after
their removal from Hamburg, lay in an Irish gaol awaiting
their trial.</p>

<p>Tandy, finding the evidence against him overwhelming,
admitted the accuracy of the indictment, and was sentenced
to die on the fourth of the ensuing May. In this course he was
doubtless influenced by his son, with whom, as will be seen,
McNally, the debauched legal adviser of the rebels, could do
what he liked.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Meanwhile Napoleon, on his return from
Egypt, claimed him as a French general, and held an English
prisoner of equal rank a hostage for his safety. It was now
not so clear that Pitt had a legal claim to the life of a man
who wore the uniform of a French officer, and had come into
his hands under circumstances the most peculiar.</p>

<p>As regards Blackwell, the fellow-prisoner of Tandy,
Portland, writing to Cornwallis, speaks of having been importuned
by Mrs. Blackwell's family, whom he describes as
'of considerable influence in Somersetshire,' and imagines
that 'there is no intention of inflicting any punishment on
Mr. Blackwell.'<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Soon after we find Blackwell<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> discharged, but,
unlike Morres, he proudly refused to give bail. Morres after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>an imprisonment of more than three years regained his liberty
on December 10, 1801. Tandy, less fortunate, was removed to
Wicklow gaol, and his son asserts that while there the French
minister in London signified that Buonaparte had sent directions
to his brother Joseph not to sign the treaty of peace 'at
Amiens' till Tandy was restored. M. Otto had in fact, as
Bourrienne states,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> previously negotiated with Lord Hawkesbury
for his release. Mr. Froude says that 'Tandy was
spared as too contemptible to be worth punishing.'<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> This
hardly conveys a true idea of the facts. A pardon was at last
made out for him on condition of banishment to Botany Bay.
To this proviso his son demurred; but, as Mr. Marsden, the
Under Secretary at Dublin Castle, assured him, 'all that was
required was merely the name of <em>transportation</em>, in order to
strike terror into others; and that he would pledge his honour,
if he acquiesced, that his father should be landed wherever he
pleased, that it might appear to the world as if he made his
escape at sea.'<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Tandy arrived at Bordeaux on March 14, 1802. Bonaparte's
treaty with England was signed on the 27th of
the same month. Military honours hailed Tandy. Bordeaux
was illuminated, and he was promoted to the rank of a
general of division. But in the midst of this jubilee the old
rebel read with horror a speech of Pelham's in Parliament
stating that 'Tandy owed his life to the useful information
and discoveries he had given to the British Government.' He
addressed a letter to Pelham, now a peer, branding the statement
as mean, audacious, and false. 'This may appear
uncouth language to a courtly ear,' he added; 'but it is
the voice of truth. I never had any connection or correspondence
with your Government, and if I had, they knew my
character too well to attempt to tamper with me. Had you
contented yourself with saying, "there were particular circumstances
in my case," you would have adhered to the truth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>for you know the whole, though you have let out only a
part!' Tandy thus concluded: 'I am, my Lord, with the same
sentiments which I have uniformly cherished and supported,
a friend to universal benevolence, and an enemy to those only
who raise their fortunes on their country's ruin!'</p>

<p>Pelham probably confounded Napper Tandy with James
Tandy, from whom information had been given to his confidant,
McNally, and by 'Mac' conveyed to Dublin Castle.
Napper told his son all, not thinking it would transpire. His
feelings had been roused by the imputation, and in a letter
to the 'Argus' he gave them fuller vent. 'Had discoveries
been proposed to me, I should have rejected, with scorn and
indignation, a baseness which my soul abhorred.... I had
made up my mind for death in a cause which no mode of
execution could stamp disgrace upon. It would have been
death in the cause of freedom and of my country&mdash;a cause
which would have converted the scaffold into an altar, the
sufferer into a victim!'</p>

<p>Mr. Elliot, who, I think, afterwards succeeded his brother
as Lord St. Germans, echoed in Parliament the taunt cast by
Pelham, and spoke of 'Tandy's ignorance and insignificant
birth.'<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Tandy, addressing Elliot, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The illiberal attack which you have made upon me in your speech
of the 24th of November last, in the British House of Commons, is
the cause of my troubling you with this. My '<em>ignorance and insignificance</em>,'
which you have painted in such glowing colours, ought,
with a man of sense, to have been my protection; but you have
proved yourself as deficient in this, as in point of good manners,
which is the true criterion of a gentleman.</p>

<p>You cannot, sir, but know (for you pretend to be a man of information)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>that I hold a high rank in the army of this great and
generous nation, which places me upon a footing with the proudest
peer of your island. You know, also, that the honour of a soldier
is dearer to him than life; yet, with these facts before you, you
have dared to traduce my character, and have attempted to affix a
stigma to my name which nothing can now wipe out but the blood
of one of us. <em>A French officer must not be insulted with impunity</em>,
and you, as well as the country which gave me birth, and that
which has adopted me, shall find that I will preserve the honour of
my station. I, therefore, demand of you to name some town on
the Continent where you will be found, accompanied by your friend
and your pistols&mdash;giving me sufficient time to leave this, and arrive
at the place appointed.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Napper Tandy</span>, General of Division.</p>
<p>Bourdeaux, December 12, 1802.</p>
</div>

<p>Eight weeks elapsed. Elliot failed to reply, and Tandy,
in accordance with the fashion of the day, proclaimed him 'a
calumniator, a liar, and a poltroon!' This fierce climax
was preceded by a more temperate tone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question in debate [he said, when Elliot assailed him] was
for laying a tax on Great Britain, in which I, as a French citizen,
could not possibly be implicated, and, therefore, it is evident that I
was wantonly dragged in for the sole purpose of calumny and abuse.
Such conduct was unmanly, as no brave man would attack a
defenceless person, much less an absent one.</p></div>

<p>Ignorant of the source to which his betrayal was due, it did
not occur to Tandy that the speeches of Elliot and others may
have aimed at diverting suspicion from their real informant.
Tandy, in reply, advanced merely the suspicion that the charge
of being an informer was fulminated to excite the jealousy
and disgust of his adopted country France, which, unlike
America, had opened her arms to afford him protection.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The wearing worry of Tandy's later life had sapped his
strength, and left him sensitively open to hostile shafts, which
his conduct provoked. His vanity was commensurate with
his patriotism, and in his stoutest day was easily wounded.
He gradually sank, and died at Bordeaux in 1803. 'His private
character,' writes Barrington, 'furnished no ground to doubt
the integrity of his public one.' He died, as he had lived, a
staunch Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Much has been written of the wonderful escape from
Kilmainham Gaol of Corbet, afterwards a general in the French
service, and one of the prisoners captured with Tandy at
Hamburg, and thence removed to Dublin. Miss Edgeworth
was so much struck by this romantic escape, that she made
it the leading incident of her best novel. But, considering the
subtle international difficulties that had arisen, and with the
suggestion of Under-Secretary Marsden before us, it is a question
how far Corbet's escape may not have been connived at
by Castlereagh.</p>

<p>The sermon which Napoleon preached to the Hamburg
deputies on their infringement of the law of nations was in the
mouths of his admirers for years after; but it lost in impressiveness
by his own violation of the neutral territory of Baden,
when, on the night of March 17, 1804, he sent a strong guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to seize and carry off to France the Duc d'Enghien. After a
hasty trial by court-martial, and on unproven charges of conspiracy,
he was cruelly put to death in the Castle of Vincennes.
In the heated discussions to which this outrage gave rise,
Buonaparte more than once quoted the case of Tandy, and
feebly sought to find in the past conduct of Hamburg a precedent
and justification.</p>

<p>Thomas Addis Emmet accused him of coldness and indecision
as regards the long threatened invasion of Ireland,
because, instead of steering for Erin in 1798, he changed his
plan and went to Egypt. The arrest of Tandy in Hamburg rekindled
Napoleon's hostile feeling, and shortly after the death
of that general he resolved to carry out comprehensively his
oft-mooted design.</p>

<p>The 'Correspondence of Napoleon'<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> contains a letter to
Berthier, dated September 27, 1804. He says that an expedition
to Ireland had been decided upon; that 18,000 men for
that purpose were ready at Brest; that a simultaneous landing
was to be attempted in Kent; while in Ireland the French army
would march straight on Dublin. Meanwhile 200,000 men
were encamped at Boulogne; but hostile plans collapsed with
the smash of the French fleet at Trafalgar. A few weeks later
the so-called 'Army of England' traversed the banks of the
blue Danube instead of the Thames. General Mack capitulated
at Ulm; Francis of Austria fled, and Napoleon's legions
entered Vienna.</p>

Dublin prison on November 19, 1798, three days before the arrest of Tandy.
Tone and Turner were closely associated in their studies, distinctions, and

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

ARREST OF J√ÑGERHORN IN LONDON&mdash;THE PLOT THICKENS&mdash;TURNER
SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD</h2>


<p>In 1799, Turner's stealthy steps can be traced once more in
London. It will be remembered that Lord Edward Fitzgerald
had met, by appointment near Whitechapel, M. J√§gerhorn, a
secret envoy of France, and gave him, in full detail, information
regarding every point on which that agent had been
charged to inquire. J√§gerhorn was 'the estimable Swede' named
by Reinhard, the French minister at Hamburg, when writing
the intercepted letter. This document, dated July 12, the
editor of the 'Castlereagh Papers' assigns to the year 1798;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> but
as Lord Edward was dead at that time,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> it must belong to the
previous year. Other secret missives were sent to Dublin at
the same time by the Home Office, in order to guide the
course of the Irish Government. These papers, filling forty
pages of the book,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> were the result of a successful stroke of
espionage at Hamburg.</p>

<p>M. J√§gerhorn is of course the person alluded to by Mr.
Froude when describing the nocturnal visit to Lord Downshire.
'He [Lord Edward] had been watched in London, and had
been traced to the lodgings of a suspected agent of the French
Directory, and among other papers which had been forwarded
by spies to the Government, there was one in French containing
an allusion to some female friend of Lady Edward, through
whom a correspondence was maintained between Ireland and
Paris.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Hamburg was Turner's usual residence, and J√§gerhorn had
an estate near that place.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Although the case of M. J√§gerhorn is opened in the first
volume of the 'Castlereagh Papers,' and misplaced among the
incidents of another year, we do not find until far in the second
the letters addressed to him in 1797 by General Valence and
Lord Edward. In 1799 J√§gerhorn had sought to renew his
perilous enterprise. The same keen scent which traced Lord
Edward, in 1797, to the lodgings of the confidential envoy in
London, was once more on his track. Wickham, writing
from the Home Office on March 28, 1799, has news for Castlereagh
in Dublin: 'I have the satisfaction to inform your
lordship that we have secured M. J√§gerhorn, who was coming
over here on a mission similar to that which he undertook
some two years since, when he met Lord Edward Fitzgerald
in London.'</p>

<p>A full report is given of J√§gerhorn's examination, in which
he is asked: 'Were you not charged to deliver to Lord
Edward Fitzgerald a letter from somebody?' and he replied,
'Madame Matthiessen.' This was the lady, nearly connected
with Lady Edward, and alluded to by Mr. Froude as a name
found in secret papers. He is further questioned about Lord
Edward, Lady Lucy, General Valence, and a number of other
persons whose names had cropped up in the interview between
Turner and Downshire; but, though the queries were searching,
and J√§gerhorn now seemed completely in Pitt's power, nothing
material was wrung from him. England and Russia were at
this time allied, and J√§gerhorn, pretending that he had a
pension of 2,000 roubles as a spy of Russia, rather dumb-foundered
his examiners, and he at last regained his liberty.
All this is to be found, with full details, in the 'Correspondence
of Lord Castlereagh.'</p>

<p>The paltry sum which Turner received for his services now
comes to be considered. This man, who had every facility
of access to Lady Edward's house at Hamburg and its rebel
<em>entourage</em>, held the key of a position so incalculably important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that he never himself discerned its marketable value.
Thousands would doubtless just as readily have been paid to
him as 'the cool 500<em>l.</em>' that he modestly asked. 'To get the
information had cost him,' he said, 'three times that sum, and
to keep up the acquaintances and connections he had at
Hamburg he could not live on less.' 'Small profits and quick
returns' seems to have been his motto.</p>

<p>'Fresh evidence of the person's power to be useful,' writes
Froude, 'made Pitt extremely anxious to secure his permanent
help.' The Cornwallis papers record, but without any attempt
to identify him, that the pension Samuel Turner received&mdash;dating
from 1800&mdash;was but 300<em>l.</em> a year. Wellington when
Irish Secretary addressed to Portland a letter in which a present
payment of 5,000<em>l.</em>, and 'not more than 20,000<em>l.</em> within the
year,' appears guaranteed to one nameless informer.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Another case may be cited. A document placed in my
hands by Sir W. Cope, Bart., records that his grandfather
was told by Under-Secretary Cooke to stop at no sum, not
even 100,000<em>l.</em>, in urging Reynolds to turn approver. Reynolds,
not realising the importance of his evidence, consented to
take 5,000<em>l.</em> and 1,000<em>l.</em> a year, with the post of British consul.
The tergiversation of Reynolds did not take place until 1798,
long after Turner had sold the pass.</p>

<p>The services of 'Downshire's friend' were more timely
and, perhaps, more valuable. He told what he knew in
1797: the names he gave of the Executive Committee (p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>,
<i lang="la">ante</i>) proved more important than might appear at first sight.
Reynolds, it is true, gave the hint that a Committee would
be found sitting at Bond's on March 12, 1798, but he does
not seem to have disclosed names; his son says that the
names were inserted in the warrant purely 'on speculation.'<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>As regards the more distinct whisper of Turner, the betrayal
of the Belfast Directory, at the very hour that Tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>was leaving Brest with a French fleet, proved in itself a
paralysing blow, and one worth its weight in gold. But the
arm that dealt it struck from behind unseen. However,
as most of the information that Downshire's friend gave
concerned the Northern organisation, he may, perhaps, be
credited with this exploit. The loss of Ulster was the loss of
the right arm of the rebellion. Turner made his disclosures
on October 8, 1797. Besides the list of the Executive Directory,
there can be no doubt that in the information which
followed he named, with others, John Hughes of Belfast, the
date and place of whose arrest tally with the presumption that
to Turner it was due. The 'History of Belfast' records:
'October 20, 1797&mdash;John Hughes, bookseller, having been
apprehended <em>in Newry</em><a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> on a charge of high treason, was
brought in here escorted by a party of light dragoons.'<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Mr.
Froude says that 'Downshire's friend' kept him informed of
everything.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>How well Turner knew Hughes is proved by the sworn
testimony of the latter,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> in which he describes a breakfast in
June 1797, with Samuel Turner, Teeling, Macnevin, etc.,
when the fitness of the country for an immediate rising was
debated. Hughes had been a great patriot previously, but
now to save himself became a mercenary informer, and even
sought to criminate Grattan, who thereupon was dismissed
from the Privy Council, though, as Stanhope<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> admits, without
just cause. There had been no more zealous propagandist of
the rebellion than Hughes, and he names a long list of men
whom he himself had sworn in on a prayer-book. In 1802
John Hughes retired to the United States and became a slave-owner.</p>

<p>Wickham's letter of June 8, 1798, enumerated, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>information of Lord Castlereagh, a number of men whose
arrests in England seem consequent on the information
furnished by Downshire's visitor. These names include
McGuckin, the attorney, who had been concerned for O'Coigly
at Maidstone. The subsequent career of this once determined
rebel, but who soon after his arrest in 1798 became a spy for
the Crown, enhances the importance of Turner's information
at a great crisis. The first recorded payment to McGuckin
of secret service money is March 5, 1799.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> His son migrated
to France, and was created a baron by Louis Philippe.</p>

<p>The peril of assassination which shadowed every step made
by Turner was not adequately weighed by Pitt when estimating
the value of his services. The risk he ran was not confined
to Ireland. The life of an English spy abroad was
deemed equally unsafe, and there is much reason to fear that
more than one met with short shrift. Even a successful
diplomat, if his subtlety touched French interests, could not
regard his life as safe. The disappearance of Benjamin
Bathurst, a kinsman of Earl Bathurst, has never been explained.
Bathurst was sent on a secret mission to Vienna,
at the time that England before opening the Peninsular
campaign sought to persuade Austria to declare, by way of
a distraction, war against France. Austria soon after crossed
the French frontier, and Bathurst received hints of threatened
personal doom. Hoping to avoid assassination, he took a
northerly route in returning to England, and on reaching
Perleberg in Brandenburg, he visited, in his agitation, the
commandant of cuirassiers, requesting that sentries might
mount guard at the inn where he stopped. These were
supplied, and Bathurst spent the day in writing and destroying
letters. Shortly before his carriage came to the door in
the dark of a November evening, he told some troopers who
escorted him that they might withdraw. While all the household
was on the alert to see him off, he walked beyond the
circle of the lantern glare, and was lost to sight at the heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of the horses. This occurred on November 25, 1809, and
Bathurst was never seen or heard of more, notwithstanding
that, as we are reminded by Baring Gould, England offered
2,000<em>l.</em> reward, and Prussia 100 Friedrichs d'or, for the discovery
even of his remains.</p>

<p>To trace the spy with whom these chapters mainly deal
seemed, at the outset, almost as hopeless as to find Bathurst's
bones. Of all the Government informers not one has been
more ingeniously guarded from discovery. Wellington, with
all his astuteness, supposed that the fact of a man's name
appearing in the Banishment Act was conclusive evidence
against him of having been a rebel,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and therefore disqualified
from claiming any favour from the Crown. But had he known
the secret history of Turner's case, it would have opened his
eyes. A Fugitive Bill was passed in July 1798, enumerating
the rebel leaders who had fled from justice. In this bill we
find Samuel Turner named. During the following year
Parliament was asked to lend itself to the fraud of branding
as a traitor the same Samuel Turner, by passing against him
an Act of Attainder. From 1797 he lived abroad, posing as
an 'exile of Erin.'<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The sealed chest in Dublin Castle which was opened a few
years ago contained the only letter I ever saw signed with
Turner's name. It related to his pension, and it was necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>to lay the mask aside for once. We have already seen
him styled Furnes, Richardson, and especially 'Lord Downshire's
friend.'<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> A new name is now adopted to puzzle
posterity. He directs that 500<em>l.</em> be lodged to the account of
'J. Destinger,' and this sum he was to draw through a third
party. Turner's letter is addressed, not to Dublin Castle, but to
Cooke in London, that gentleman having been succeeded, as
Under-Secretary for Ireland, by Mr. Marsden.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<em>Rt. Hon<sup>ble</sup> Mr. Secretary Cooke.</em><a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
<p class="right">Hamburg: May 18, 1802.</p>


<p>Sir,&mdash;In consequence of letters I've had the honour of receiving
from Lord Castlereagh and Sir James Craufurd, I take the liberty
of intruding relative to a pension of 300<em>l.</em> per annum the Government
has thought proper to bestow on me for information on Irish
affairs.</p>

<p>His lordship states that you have been so kind as to offer to pay
the pension to any person I would name as agent&mdash;or in any way I
was to propose. At present there is no person in Ireland I'd like to
trust, and till some mode is adopted, I should be extremely obliged
if you'd take the trouble of lodging in any bank in London the sum
of 500<em>l.</em> (British) on account of J. Destinger&mdash;the name I shall draw
it under&mdash;through Sir Geo. Rumbold.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Now that the war is over, and it is <em>supposed</em> all persons in my
line are discharged, I make it a point to spend much more money
than heretofore in order to do away any idea of my being employed
and income diminished, and it is for that reason I request your
attention, and beg the honour of a line through Sir George to say
where the draft is to be sent.</p>

<p>Hoping one day or other to merit your good opinion, I remain,
most respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">S. Turner.</span></p></div>

<p>Turner spent money freely, and often when he could ill
afford it. He had a social status to maintain: he was the son
of a county magistrate; had distinguished himself in college;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>belonged to an honourable profession. He was the trustee of
marriage settlements. He was 'Lord Downshire's friend!'
If he continued to wear his mask well, why might he not
aspire to attain, in America at least, the high official rank of
his late colleague and fellow-prisoner, Thomas Addis Emmet,
whom she at last honoured by a public funeral and a monument
raised by national subscription?</p>

<p>The 'Dublin Directory' for 1804 describes Samuel Turner's
address as 58 St. Stephen's Green, in that city. The volume
must have been compiled during the previous year, and it
may be that the Irish Government, in 1808, removed him to
Dublin, with the object of picking the brains of those who had
been concerned in Emmet's rebellion of that year. Until the
very night of its outburst, in July 1808, the existence of a
slumbering volcano had not been suspected. After the vain
attempts to convict and hang Tandy, Turner had returned to
his old quarters.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The Irish Government were wholly unprepared for Emmet's
revolt. No wonder that Wickham, with the experience he
had acquired, confessed amazement that the secret should
have been kept so well.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Secretary of State cried out with astonishment to think
that such a preparation for revolution could be carried on in the
very bosom of the seat of Government, without discovery, for so
long a time, when any of the party could have made their fortunes
by a disclosure of the plot; and remarked, at the same time,
in presence of Mr. Stafford and the two Mr. Parrots, John and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>William, that it was because they were mostly all mechanics,
or working people, that the thing was kept so profound; and said
that if the higher orders of society had been connected, they would
divulge the plot for the sake of gain.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p></div>

<p>Turner was at once set in motion: but how? We find him
put into the same gaol with a swarm of State prisoners,
many of whom had been active in 1798. All daily met for
exercise in the yard of Kilmainham Gaol, and had every opportunity
for converse. Here Robert Emmet himself had been
confined until the very day of his execution.</p>

<p>The execution was followed by that of several of his confederates.
Let us look back. Martial law is proclaimed; a
dead calm prevails. Turner is now traced stealthily making
his way to the Secretary of State's Office, Dublin Castle.
Anxious to avoid committing himself in writing, especially
with a true signature, he seeks the safer medium of oral communication.
Mr. Marsden cannot be seen; he is engaged
just then in conference with the chief law officer of the Crown.
Turner scribbles the following and sends it in; no signature
is attached, but the paper and enclosure are endorsed, by
Marsden, 'Mr. Samuel Turner':&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Understanding the Attorney-General is just with you, I take
the liberty of sending in a letter of Mr. Ball, but wish to speak on
other matters.</p></div>

<p>Sergeant Ball's letter is dated</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Temple St., October 3, 1803.</p>

<p>I have looked into the Act of Parliament and considered in what
manner you should proceed in order to do away the effect of the
attainder thereby passed against you. Nothing short of an Act of
Parliament, reversing the former as far as it affects you, will be
sufficient to enable you to sue for your property in our courts of
justice. I think you mentioned that some other plan had been suggested
as sufficient. If you will let me know what it is, I will give
it the most attentive consideration.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>How Marsden and the Attorney-General settled the difficulty,
no correspondence exists to show; but the London 'Courier'
of December 5, 1803, most lucidly reveals the facts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On Friday last, Samuel Turner, Esq., barrister-at-law, was
brought to the bar of the Court of King's Bench, in custody of the
keeper of Kilmainham Prison, under a charge of attainder, passed
in the Irish Parliament, as one concerned in the Rebellion of the
year 1798; but having shown that he was no way concerned therein,
that he had not been in the country for a year and seven months
prior to passing that Act&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> for thirteen months prior to the
rebellion&mdash;and therefore could not be the person alluded to, his
Majesty's Attorney-General confessed the same, and Mr. Turner
was discharged accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p></div>

<p>The 'Dublin Evening Post' of the day states that Turner's
arrest was due simply to his indiscretion in visiting Ireland
on business arising from the death of his father.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> But as the
'Post' in 1803 had been subsidised by the Crown, this account
was probably meant to mislead. The Castle archives bulge
with the brimful letters of its editor, H. B. Code. Turner's
committal to Kilmainham was only another act in the great
drama, one scene of which Mr. Froude has so powerfully put
before us. 'Samuel Turner, Esquire,' of imposing presence
and indomitable mien, a veteran in 'the cause,' the man who
had challenged the Commander-in-Chief, the envoy to France,
the exile of Erin, the friend of Lord Edward and Pamela,
the disinherited by his father, the victim of State persecution,
now stood before his fellow-prisoners the 'Ecce Homo' of
martyrdom, commanding irresistibly their confidence.</p>

<p>Of his detention in Kilmainham Dr. Madden knows no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>thing;
but he mentions that Turner accompanied the State
prisoners&mdash;nineteen in number&mdash;to Fort George in Scotland,
the final scene of their captivity. Here Turner's work was so
adroitly performed that we find a man of incorruptible integrity
suspected instead. Arthur O'Connor told John Patten that
Thomas Addis Emmet 'gave information of a letter which
O'Connor was writing, through which means Government
became acquainted with the circumstance.' A long correspondence
on the subject has been published by Madden.
Emmet at last challenged O'Connor. Patten,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> the brother-in-law
of Emmet, was told to bring a certain pair of duelling
pistols to Fort George; but, thanks to the efforts of Robert
Emmet to allay the dispute, the weapons were not used. It
was Patten's impression that Turner's machinations had set
the two friends by the ears. Although O'Connor apologised,
and both parties shook hands, it is painful to add that half
a century after, when the upright Emmet had been more
than twenty years dead, O'Connor, in his book 'Monopoly,'
stigmatised him as a man of bad faith. A suspicion more
baseless was never uttered. In this book the name of his
fellow-prisoner, Turner, is not once mentioned. Indeed,
the inference is that he thought well of Turner; for O'Connor,
after criticising the Catholic members of the Directory, declares
that he had much greater reliance on the <em>Northern</em> chiefs.
O'Connor, Emmet, Neilson and others were detained at
Fort George until the Peace of Amiens, and then enlarged on
condition that they should expatriate themselves for ever.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>In 1807 Sir Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington,
entered on his duties as Irish Secretary. A letter, dated
Dublin Castle, December 5, 1807, and addressed to the Admiralty,
recommends a midshipman in the navy, Francis
Turner, for promotion. 'He is the son of a Mr. Turner in this
country, who has strong claims to the favour of the Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>for the loyalty and zeal with which he conducted himself
during the rebellion in Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Doubtless the new hand
merely wrote in this letter what the permanent officials
prompted.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Downshire, although a staunch Tory of the old school,
uniformly supported the Catholic claims. This example probably
influenced his <em>prot√©g√©</em>. O'Connell, while inculcating
moral force in his struggle for civil and religious liberty, was
fond of enlisting in his bodyguard men who in more troubled
times had staked their lives and fortunes for Ireland. He had
himself been a 'United Irishman,' as will be shown. The rebel
General Clony presided as chairman at the Catholic Association.
Rowan, Teeling and 'Con' McLoughlin sat at the Council
board, or stood on the National platform. What confidence
must not O'Connell have reposed in the man who, as will appear,
avowed himself ready to die for his chief!</p>

<p>An aged gentleman, Patrick O'Byrne, who was born at
Newry, almost under the shadow of Turner's patrimonial gable,
but who never once doubted his fidelity to the cause in which
O'Byrne himself has been no silent ally, supplies a fact of
sufficiently curious import:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Orange ascendancy faction resolved to put O'Connell
out of the way [he writes], and their champion, the unfortunate
D'Esterre, horsewhip in hand, was ostentatiously parading the
streets of Dublin, accompanied by leering friends, to compel
O'Connell to fight him, Mr. Samuel Turner took up his position in
a hotel where it was known D'Esterre would go to seek O'Connell.
He had not been there long before D'Esterre and his staff entered
and inquired for O'Connell. Immediately Mr. Turner advanced
and stated that his friend Mr. O'Connell was not there, but he&mdash;Mr.
Turner&mdash;was there to represent him. No: they did not want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Mr. O'Connell's friend; the Liberator himself was the object of
their search. Mr. Turner, with the same spirit that he had challenged
Lord Carhampton, now declared that he adopted Mr.
O'Connell's words, publicly uttered, and made himself responsible
for his actions. In vain; none but O'Connell himself would serve
their purpose, and Mr. Turner was denied the opportunity of doing
battle for his friend.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p></div>

<p>All this time it cannot be said that, although undiscovered,
Turner was still a happy man. The dread spectre of assassination
ceased not to haunt him. 'After long experience of
the world,' says Junius, 'I affirm before God I never knew a
rogue who was not unhappy.' Nor was Turner's presentiment
surprising. McSkimmin's History of Carrickfergus, 103-73, in his 'History of Carrickfergus,'
states that the pistol and the dagger were no uncommon
means of dealing with informers; and he supplies a
list of men who thus suffered.</p>

<p>Books which treat of 'Ninety-eight' often mention Byrne
of Dundalk. In 1869 the late Mr. John Mathews of that town
gathered from Byrne's representative, Mr. P. J. Byrne, Clerk
of the Crown, several facts, and, in enclosing them to me,
styled his informant 'the highest authority on the unpublished
history of the County.' Two days later Mr. Byrne was no
more. The inquiries I then made had no reference to Samuel
Turner, but some passing notices of this man which occur in
the manuscript are useful in now supplying missing links.
Mr. Mathews was an ardent patriot, and he described, not
without emotion, how Turner died. Regarding him as a
rebel true to the end, he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Turner went to the Isle of Man, and having quarrelled there with
a Mr. Boyce, agreed that the dispute should be settled by an appeal to
arms. Both, with their friends, repaired to the field of honour, and
as Turner was preparing for the struggle his adversary shot him
through the head; and [adds Matthews] thus terminated the career
of a man whose only regret was that his life was not lost in the
service of his country.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p></div>

<p>Was the vengeance wreaked by Boyce meant as a tardy retribution?
Was the John Boyce, who with five other prisoners
was consigned in 1797 to Carrickfergus Gaol, connected
with the Boyce who shot Turner? What Boyce had against
Turner was a secret which died with both. No proceedings
seem to have been taken against the man by whose hand he
fell. And possibly this forbearance was not uninfluenced by
the fact that the Crown had need no longer for their informer's
services, but, on the contrary, gained by his death. Turner
was a clever man, troublesome to deal with, haughty, touchy,
and resentful; and, like Maguan,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Bird and Newell, he might
at any moment publicly turn upon his employers and betray
them with as little compunction as he had already sold his
comrades.</p>

<p>A word as regards Lord Downshire, through whom Turner's
disclosures were at first conveyed. This peer, who at one time
had wielded potential influence at Whitehall, and had the ear
of Pitt, lived to fall into deep disfavour with Government. He
steadily opposed the Legislative Union, and helped to form a
joint-stock purse with the object of out-bribing Dublin Castle.
In chastisement he was dismissed from the Lord Lieutenancy
of Down, deprived of his rank as colonel, expelled from the
Privy Council, and threatened with a parliamentary inquiry
into his conduct. These blows told, and on September 7,
1801, he breathed his last.</p>

named McCann; but it is just as likely to have been that finished actor, Turner
himself. So prominent and conversable a man must have been well known to
Thomas Campbell, then a strong Radical, and who, as he tells us, wrote the
'Exile,' at Altona, near Hamburg, in 1801; and it suggests conflicting emotions
to speculate as to how far the figure of Turner, in his slouched hat, gazing
wistfully from the beach, in search of prey, may have influenced the beautiful
idea of the poet:&mdash;

<span class="i2">To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.<br /></span>

the Record Tower, Dublin Castle. Two unsigned letters supplying private information
in 1803 have puzzled their official custodians. St. John Mason&mdash;a
cousin of the ill-fated Robert Emmet&mdash;is the man mainly sought to be incriminated.
The letters are endorsed 'R.' and I observed, in holding up one against the light,
that the capitals 'S. T. 1801,' appear as the watermark. 'R' is the cypher
by which Castlereagh points to 'Richardson,' <em>alias</em> Turner, in his letter to
Wickham (p. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <i lang="la">ante</i>). The case of St. John Mason and his prolonged
imprisonment without trial was brought before Parliament in 1812. The
Duke of Richmond&mdash;then Viceroy&mdash;wrote a despatch and made allusion to the
above letters. 'Who the writer may have been I know not,' observes his
Grace, 'but he appears to have been some secret informer of the Government.'
This despatch was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed June 2, 1812.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

EFFORTS TO EXCITE MUTINY IN THE ENGLISH FLEET</h2>


<p>Of Duckett, an amateur rebel envoy, mentioned in connection
with the arrest of Napper Tandy,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> something remains to
be said. He was a man of very active habits, and if less impulsive
would have had more friends. Tone, already the
victim of misplaced confidence, viewed many men with suspicion,
and let them see it. In 1796 he was passing as a
French officer, and mentions in his diary that, when waiting
to see De la Croix, the minister of war at Paris, Duckett, who
chanced to be also in the ante-room, sought to enter into
conversation with Tone by handing him an English newspaper.
Advances of this sort, though natural in an exiled Irishman
meeting another, were not without effect in making Tone
distrust and avoid him.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Duckett no doubt had projects connected
with the enterprise in hand to which the chivalrous
Tone would not stoop; but of these Tone knew little, and his
prejudice was formed on quite different grounds. These
suspicions were shared by Madgett, an official in the French
War Office. Duckett, it appears, told Madgett that two
expeditions were to proceed to Ireland. 'Madgett said that
he had endeavoured to put Duckett off the scent by saying he
did not believe one word of the story, but that Duckett continued
positive.' Tone adds that the information was probably true;
but that it was terribly provoking it should be known to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Duckett, 'to whom, by the by, De la Croix revealed in confidence
all that he knew, for which he ought to be damned.' Tone
later on admits that he knows nothing against Duckett unless
by report.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Tone's unhealthy impression Dr. Madden caught contagiously.
In the first edition of his book, published forty
years ago, he conveys that Duckett was a spy subsidised by
England.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Innuendo grew at last into accusation, and a more
recent edition records that Duckett, 'there is good reason to
believe, was not employed by the Irish Directory, but by the
British Minister, Mr. Pitt.'<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Again, we are told that Duckett
was '<em>assuming</em> the character of an agent of the United Irishmen
at Paris, and continually dodged Tone in all his movements.'<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>I cannot endorse this imputation. In no pension list, or
account of secret service money, is the name of Duckett
to be traced; nor is there one line to criminate him in the
archives of the Home Office. Nay more. Open the 'Castlereagh
Papers,' and there Duckett is found denounced as a sworn
enemy to England. These valuable State papers were published
ten years previous to the issue of Dr. Madden's revised
edition; but, uninfluenced by their revelations, he renews the
charges against Duckett.</p>

<p>Guillon, who has had access to the Government archives
in France, says that Truguet, Minister of Marine, had thrown
himself heart and soul into the projected invasion, and proposed
to land 30,000 men in Ireland, under Hoche; and 60,000
later on in England; but the Directory deemed the plan too
daring, and threw it aside; until Tone's memorials made their
thoughts recur to invasion, and they then adopted a portion of
the rejected scheme of Truguet.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> An interesting letter from
Duckett to Truguet, Minister of Marine, turns up among the
intercepted despatches. This functionary had just been succeeded
by a new hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Is the Government still resolved to prosecute the same plans
and the same projects [Duckett asks]. Can my country rely on its
promises? Let me know, I beseech you in the name of Liberty,
what is to be done? Shall I go home to accelerate the period for
the arrival of which we are all solicitous? Consider that it is only
patriots and enemies of England who risk anything&mdash;it is their
blood that will flow.</p>

<p>The fears I had lest I should not be able to convert your bill
into money are unfortunately realised. I have presented it to
Citizen Reinhard, explained to him who I was, and what I was
going to do. I showed him how necessary it was that I should
leave Hamburg. He replied that his personal means did not
permit him to comply with my application, adding that he could
not act, because I had not a particular letter for him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A mysterious task and goal are glanced at.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am grievously mortified that I am not at this moment at the
place of my destination. You know how deeply I interest myself in
this cause; my presence will be conducive to the success of our
friends. I wait for nothing but your answer to set out. I would
merely request you to speak about me to your successor, to explain to
him my situation and my necessities, in order that he may take into
consideration the expenses which I shall be absolutely obliged to
incur; for, when once arrived at my post, it will perhaps be impossible
for me to receive assistance from him. I therefore beg of
you to make him put me beyond the reach of accidents, by causing
a sum that will afford me the means of subsisting and acting to be
remitted to Hamburg. It does not belong to me to fix it. It is for
him in his wisdom to see what sum will be necessary and indispensable
for the expenses of six months. It would be superfluous to
assure you of my attachment to the cause, and of the high consideration
which I have for you personally.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Address your answer to Citizen Reinhard: it is he who
undertakes to forward this letter to you.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p></div>

<p>It will be remembered that the betrayer whom Mr. Froude
dramatically pictures as unbosoming himself to Downshire was
the confidant of Reinhard at Hamburg, had access to his house,
and used that fact to prove that his services, as an informer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
were worth purchase by Pitt. I have elsewhere shown that the
letters headed 'Secret Information from Hamburg,' which have
crept into the 'Castlereagh Papers' to puzzle the world,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> can
only have been written by 'Lord Downshire's friend'&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
Turner. One appears at page <a href="#Page_306">306</a> of the first volume of that
work. <em>There</em> the objects vaguely broached by Duckett are
revealed as plainly as though Reinhard himself had whispered
the word. The spy, having furnished other items of news,
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Duckett is at Hamburg; he has denounced Stone at Paris as a
traitor.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> I hear he [Duckett] has got money from the [French]
Government for the purpose of renewing the mutiny in the English
Fleet.'<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p></div>

<p>Obstinately hostile winds, as in 1796, once more saved
England. Tone, whose untiring energy had accomplished
the organisation of the invading forces, soliloquises in his
diary of 1 August, 1797:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am, to-day, twenty-five days aboard, and at a time when
twenty-five hours are of importance. There seems to be a fate in
this business. Five weeks&mdash;I believe six weeks&mdash;the English Fleet
was paralysed by the mutinies at Portsmouth,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Plymouth, and the
Nore. The sea was open, and nothing to prevent both the Dutch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>and French fleets to put to sea. Well, nothing was ready; that
precious opportunity, which we can never expect to return, was lost;
and now that at last we are ready here the wind is against us, the
mutiny is quelled, and we are sure to be attacked by a superior
force. At Brest it is, I fancy, still worse. Had we been in Ireland
at the moment of the insurrection at the Nore, we should beyond a
doubt have had at least that fleet, and God only knows the influence
which such an event might have had on the whole British
Navy.</p></div>

<p>Much that Tone privately penned is found confirmed by a
secret committee which sat while Parker's<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> corpse hung in
chains at Sheppey. It appeared that the crews were largely
sworn to espouse the Irish cause; 'to be faithful to their
brethren who were fighting against tyranny;' to carry a
portion of the fleet into Irish ports, hoisting, instead of the
Union Jack, a green flag emblazoned with <em>Erin-go-bragh</em>.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Madden's suggestion that Duckett was a spy of Pitt's
is reiterated with cruel consistency. Part of the grounds of
his suspicion was Duckett's intimate relations with Reinhard,
also suspected by Madden, but who is now shown conclusively
to have been true. Madden frequently quotes from the
'Castlereagh Papers,' but overlooks the following letter from
Sir J. Crawford to Lord Grenville, one wholly inconsistent
with his hypothesis that Duckett, like Turner, was a spy for
Pitt. Crawford was, of course, the British representative at
Hamburg.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">October 23, 1798.</p>

<p>I shall abstain from any measures against Duckett, continuing,
at the same time, to have him narrowly watched, which I hitherto
have so completely, that there is scarcely a single step which he
has taken since he has been at Hamburg with which I am unacquainted.
His views for the present seem to be turned principally
towards his Majesty's dockyards, and not choosing to venture in
England himself, he is very desirous of getting over hither some
one of those evil-disposed persons whom he knows to be employed
in the dockyards, for the purpose of concerting with him the means
of setting them on fire.... He is in very little esteem in France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>and is particularly ill with Talleyrand.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> His principal supporter is
Bruyes (<em>sic</em>),<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> brother to the deceased admiral, and who was Minister
of the Marine. He pretends that, in case of a successful attempt
on the part of the French to land in Ireland, his object would be to
get over to that country; but I have not hitherto been able to learn

secrecy, even with those with whom he lives in the greatest intimacy.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
He has of late been in correspondence with Holt,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> the rebel
chief, who, through him, has been pressing the French for assistance.
He says that there are 3,500 land troops on board the
squadron which lately sailed from Brest, but that they have French
uniforms for 7,000 men, with the view, as he pretends, of clothing
the first bodies of Irish that might join them in the same way as
their own troops, and thus, a numerous body appearing in French
uniforms, of impressing the Irish nation at large with an idea that
they had landed a considerable force.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p></div>

<p>This letter explains the more ambiguous despatch written
two months before. Wickham transmits, by direction of
Portland, for the information of the Irish Viceroy, a copy of a
secret note,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>which had been confirmed by the arrival of Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; [<em>i.e.</em>
Duckett] under a feigned name in Hanover, on his road to
Hamburg, and I have little doubt of the truth of the rest from
my intimate knowledge of the writer. D., by the extreme vigilance
and activity of Sir James Crawfurd, has been discovered
and arrested on his road; but, as he has been acknowledged as a
person attached to the French Mission at Hamburg, and claimed as
such, I fear there are no hopes whatever of his being delivered up,
or even of having his papers examined.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<p>Your lordship, who will be aware of the extreme delicacy of
this business, will no doubt feel the necessity of keeping the whole
of it as secret as possible. In the mean time it is a point of no
slight importance that this man should have been discovered on his
road, and his journey so much delayed as that the object of it will
be, in all probability, defeated.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p></div>

<p>Tone's prejudice against Duckett influenced Macnevin.
'Mr. Duckett is still here,' writes Reinhard to De la Croix
in another intercepted letter. 'I proposed to Mr. Macnevin
to reconcile himself with Mr. Duckett. He has refused to
do so.'</p>

<p>It is remarkable that while the usually clear-sighted
physician suspects Duckett of being an English spy, he praises
'<em>the zeal and talents of</em> <span class="smcap">Turner</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Nor is there one line in
Tone's Diary to indicate distrust of Turner; but the wrong
man, in true dramatic style, incurs suspicion and blows. On
September 21, 1797, Tone called on General Hoche at Rennes.
Hoche spoke of Duckett, and Tone destroyed him with an
expressive shrug, adding that he had boasted at Paris of his
acquaintance and influence with General Clarke, and even
with Hoche himself. Two days later Colonel Shee, the uncle
of Clarke, and who accompanied the expedition to Bantry Bay,
also inquires if Tone knew Duckett. 'I answered that
Duckett was a scoundrel. I besought him to put Hoche on
his guard.' It appeared that Duckett had made two or three
advances to Shee, who, however, had consistently avoided him.
Tone's gorge is raised, and he ends some remarks of asperity
with 'I'll Duckett him, the scoundrel, if I can catch him
fairly in my grip.'<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Duckett, according to the Hamburg spy, now shown to be
Turner, was employed by the French Government to excite
mutiny in the British fleet. Its first outburst was at
Portsmouth; it was renewed at the Nore. As historians, who
might be expected to treat largely of such incidents, barely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>notice that mutiny, a few remarks here are perhaps admissible;
the more so as it will be necessary to recur again to
Parker, who led the revolt. It assumed so formidable a
front that Truguet thought it might prove the death-blow
to England's greatness. Parker, who possessed wonderful
powers of persuasion, was soon joined by a large portion of
Lord Duncan's squadron, and became the <em>soi-disant</em> admiral
of the fleet. He blockaded the Thames, and threatened to
starve London. His mutinous force now consisted of twenty-four
sail of the line. Each ship was governed by a committee
of twelve, together with two delegates and a secretary,
and all assembled by beat of drum. The pulse of public
feeling was shown in three per cent. Consols falling to forty-five.
The Board of Admiralty visited the scene of the mutiny,
but failed to effect an arrangement. Lord Northesk, R.N.,
waited on Parker to hear his terms. These were so exacting
that Northesk hesitated. The following is culled from the
(London) 'Courier' of June 8, 1797, and it will be seen how
much Parker's letter differs from the mild version of it given
in Campbell's 'Lives of the Admirals':&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They persisted that the whole must be complied with....
Lord Northesk was now rowed on board the 'Duke of York'
Margate packet, under a flag of truce, with three cheers from
the 'Sandwich,' and with the following paper to ratify his credentials.</p>

<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">To Captain Lord Northesk.</span></p>

<p>You are hereby authorized and ordered to wait upon the King,
wherever he may be, with the Resolutions of the Committee of
Delegates, and are directed to return back with an Answer to the
same within 54 hours from the date hereof.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. Parker</span>, President.</p></div>

<p>Northesk, furnished with a passport from Parker, returned
to town, while Pitt and Dundas were hanged in effigy at the
yard-arm. It was even debated to surrender the fleet to the
French. Thereupon Sheridan suggested that all the buoys
and beacons should be removed. A paper of the day states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that the troops, ordered to fire on the fleet from the batteries
at Gravesend, broke out into mutiny themselves, declaring
that fratricide formed no part of their duty. The biographical
dictionaries say that the popularity of Northesk and the
firmness of Lord Howe caused the utter collapse of this great
mutiny; but such history is misleading. The 'Repulse' was
the first ship to abandon the cause, and becoming stranded
was mercilessly cannonaded by the fleet. Its foremast and
rigging were shot away; its decks were red with blood. Two
more deserters, the 'Agamemnon' and 'Vestal,' escaped better.
In slipping their cables and entering the Thames it was
supposed that they were carrying into effect an already
debated plan of bombarding Gravesend. The rest of the fleet
followed and found themselves snared into the hands of the
Government. When this fact became apparent, the mutineers
were filled with fury. The ships separated, turned the great
guns on each other, and fought furiously for hours, until at
last Parker succumbed. In reading the trials of the delegates
one is struck by such Celtic names as Sullivan, Donovan,
Walsh, Hughes, Brady, MacCarthy, Maginnis, Coffey, and
Branon. Strange reports were current.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The 'Courier' of
June 6, 1797, records that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>when he [Parker] was carried before the magistrates, he took two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>letters out of his pocket, saying, 'These are my authorities; it was
on these I acted.' From this it has been inferred [adds the 'Courier']
that he was set on by 'higher powers,' as the lower class call them:
they say that Parker has declared he will not die till he has garnished
Temple Bar with heads.</p></div>

<p>However, he made no distinct revelation. He was subjected
to a number of interrogatories, 'dans lesquels,' observes a
French authority, 'on chercha vainement √† d√©couvrir les
secrets moteurs de l'insurrection.'</p>

<p>Duckett's letter to Truguet, minister of marine, and the
information of the Hamburg spy, help to throw light on this
stirring episode. The mutiny is commonly ascribed to the
harsh regulations of the Admiralty. A deeper design underlay
it. Parker was at first committed to stand his trial before a
civil court; but a court-martial was suddenly substituted.
This deprived him of the forensic services of Erskine, whose
powerful eloquence had successfully defended Horne Tooke
against the Cabinet of Pitt. It was desirable that so dangerous
a man should be got rid of without delay. His application
for an adjournment was refused; and on June 30, 1797,
he suffered death.</p>

<p>These mutinies were largely the work of Duckett, acting
under the instructions of La Croix, the French minister of
war. Tone, as we have seen, hated Duckett, whom he
constantly snubs and denounces. Had there been a co-operation,
the event would doubtless have been different.
However all moderate men rejoiced at the issue. The mutiny
formed part of a scheme to sever England's right arm; but
the chivalry of Tone recoiled from a man≈ìuvre of which he
finally saw the importance while hesitating to approve of it.
Dutch and French fleets for the invasion of Great Britain
and Ireland had been nearly ready to start at the time of the
mutinies.</p>

<p>Pitt used a powerful engine in subduing the mutiny. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>despatched to the Nore a Roman Catholic priest, who impressively
preached the doctrine of submission.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> This was probably
the same priest of whom Father O'Coigly complains as
worrying him in the condemned cell in the hope of persuading
him to inform.</p>

Paper Office, reveals that Lee was discovered to have been a most determined
United Irishman, and had joined the fleet for the sole object of helping the
cause he had at heart. Lee and Duckett seem to have acted in concert. How
largely the British navy was composed of Irish sailors, and under what circumstances
their discontent originated, appear from an amusing anecdote. Shortly
before Trafalgar, the first lieutenant of a man-of-war, when making his rounds
to see that all hands were at their guns, observed an Irish sailor kneeling in
prayer: 'What! are you afraid?' exclaimed the officer. 'Afeard, indeed!'
replied the tar, contemptuously. 'I was only praying that the shots of the
French might be distributed like the prize money&mdash;the lion's share among the
officers.' Tone assured Carnot that England had recently raised 80,000 Irishmen
for her navy and marines. Carnot did not tell him in reply to reserve that
statement for the marines themselves, but took it as strict truth. The computation,
however, will not stand historic scrutiny. According to an official
return, it appears that Ireland had furnished 11,457 men for the navy, and
4,058 for the marines.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

THE BETRAYER OF LORD EDWARD FITZGERALD<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></h2>


<p>Another man there was of the same type as Turner, who
posed in impenetrable disguise, but unlike Reynolds and Armstrong,
spied in secrecy and on the express condition that he
should not be asked to give public evidence and thus damage
his social status.</p>

<p>An historian often quoted in these pages is not safe in
suggesting that we may find behind the mask of Lord Downshire's
visitor the betrayer of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The
utterly distinct quarter to which the Geraldine's arrest is due
will presently appear. Lord Edward had the command of
Leinster. Turner had mainly to do with Ulster. Guiltless
he was of Lord Edward's betrayal in Dublin, for the simple
reason, no doubt, that living abroad himself he knew nothing
of his hiding-places. All other sensational incidents of that
stirring time paled before the sorrow by which Lord Edward's
arrest and death oppressed the people. A Dublin ballad expressed
the fierce anxiety felt to discover and destroy the
veiled betrayer&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">May Heaven scorch and parch the tongue by which his life was sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrivel up the hand that clutched the proffered meed of gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Whilst, on the other hand, ballads inspired by loyal ardour
did not hesitate to regard as a holy work the annihilation of
Lord Edward Fitzgerald.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1830, when continental thrones trembled and others
fell, Moore published his interesting 'Life of Lord Edward'&mdash;a
work which, however popular and opportune, will not bear a
critical scrutiny as regards historic exactness. 'From my
mention of these particulars respecting Neilson,' writes Moore,
'it cannot fail to have struck the reader that some share of
the suspicion of having betrayed Lord Edward attaches to this
man.' Moore's book attained a wide circulation, and the
descendants of Neilson naturally felt the wounding words. A
letter of his daughter strongly protests against them, and
expresses a hope that allowance will be made 'for the indignant
feelings of a child who has always been proud of her
father's character.' Colonel Miles Byrne, a shrewd head
which narrowly escaped the axe in '98, failed to endorse
the imputation on Neilson, but hesitated not to declare
that Lord Edward had been 'betrayed, and discovered by
Reynolds, a United Irishman, to the agents of Government.'<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
In this random shot the Colonel missed his
mark. The flaming patriot, Walter Cox, often states in his
magazine that Laurence Tighe had shadowed to death the
Geraldine chief. Thereupon Dr. Brennan, in the 'Milesian
Magazine,' broadly charged Cox with the perfidy. Murphy,
an honest, simple man, in whose house Lord Edward was
taken, has not been exempted from suspicion. 'Lord
Edward's concealment,' observes Patrick Brophy, 'became
known through a soldier who was courting Murphy's servant
girl;' forgetting that Thomas Moore, in his account of
the arrest, incidentally remarks: 'an <em>old</em> maidservant
was the only person in Murphy's house besides themselves.'
Maxwell, in his 'History of the Rebellion,' said of Neilson,
'Thou art the man.' Mark O'Callaghan, in his 'Life of
O'Connell,' brands John Hughes as having received 1,000<em>l.</em>
for Lord Edward's blood, thus endorsing the indictment previously
framed by Dr. Madden.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The son and biographer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Reynolds flings suspicion on Murphy; while Murphy, in his
own account, says: 'I heard in prison that one of Lord
Edward's bodyguard had given some information.' Again,
Felix Rourke was suspected, and narrowly escaped death at
the hands of his comrades. Suspicion also attached to Mr.
Ogilvie, who, as a near connection, visited Lord Edward in
Thomas Street a few days before the arrest, and transacted
business with him. Interesting as it is, after near a century's
speculation, to know the name of the real informer, it is still
more satisfactory that those unjustly suspected should now be
finally acquitted.</p>

<p>'On the 18th of May' [1798], writes Mr. Froude, 'Major Sirr
received communications from a quarter unhinted at in the
most secret letters of the Viceroy, telling him where Lord Edward
could be found.'<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> I proceed to point out 'the quarter.'</p>

<p>In 1841 Dr. Madden obtained access to a book in which
Mr. Cooke, formerly Under-Secretary at Dublin Castle, had
made secret entries of various payments to informers.
Amongst these items is: 'June 20, 1798, F. H. discovery
of L. E. F. 1,000<em>l.</em>' Although Cooke disclosed merely the
initials 'F. H.,' he gave the name in full when recommending
the informer for a pension. Writing to Lord Castlereagh in
1799, Mr. Cooke says: 'Francis Higgins,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> proprietor of the
"Freeman's Journal," was the person who procured for me all
the intelligence respecting Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and
got &mdash;&mdash; to set him, <em>and has given me much information</em>, 300<em>l.</em>'
This 300<em>l.</em> was an annual stipend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The 'Freeman's Journal' at this time was the organ of
Dublin Castle, and it is stated in a memoir of Secretary Cooke
that he had written for that paper. Hence a frequent intercourse
subsisted between Cooke and Higgins; and the evidence
is conclusive as to Higgins having received the Government
reward. But the person of whose good name Cooke is so
careful that in writing to Castlereagh he considerately puts a
blank for it, was not so easily traced when first I took up this
inquiry. Mr. Ross, editor of the 'Cornwallis Papers,' who
was allowed to ransack the archives at Dublin Castle, writes:
'The man who gave the information which led to his [Lord
Edward's] arrest, received 1,000<em>l.</em>, <em>but his name has never transpired</em>.'</p>

<p>The point is now to prove that Francis Magan, M.A.,
barrister-at-law, a man traditionally described as one of the
most unsociable of men, was the private friend and political
ally of Higgins.</p>

<p>Thomas Magan, of High Street, Dublin, was the father of
Francis. The leading journal of that city, in its issue of June
30, 1787, records how, on the previous evening, 'Mr. Magan,
of High Street, entertained Mr. Francis Higgins' and others.
'The glass circulated freely, and the evening was spent with
the utmost festivity and sociality.' The editor concludes by
styling him '<em>Honest</em> Tom Magan.' On November 5, 1789, he
returns to the charge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Magan, the woollen-draper in High Street, in conjunction
with his friend Mr. Higgins, are preparing ropes and human brutes
to drag the new Viceroy to the palace. It was Mr. Magan and the
Sham Squire who provided the materials for the triumphal entry
of Lord Buckingham into the capital.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> ... Mr. Magan is really
clever, and never has flinched in his partiality and attention to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>cause of Mr. Francis Higgins&mdash;Mr. Magan has the honour, and that
frequently, to dine Higgins.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p></div>

<p>From an old Directory it appears that Tom Magan's loyal
zeal was acknowledged about this time by his appointment as
'Woollen Draper and Mercer to His Majesty'<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>&mdash;one of the
few paltry boons to which, in penal days, a slavish Catholic
trader dare aspire. In 1793 a Catholic Relief Bill passed,
and the bar was opened to Papists&mdash;a concession due to the
menacing attitude of the United Irishmen and the boom of
the French Revolution. Tom Magan's son, Francis, entered
Trinity College, Dublin; graduated in 1794; and became a
member of the bar&mdash;probably on the suggestion of Higgins,
who was an attorney. In 1795 Francis Magan left the
parental roof-tree in High Street and took house for himself
at 20 Usher's Island, where he continued to live until his death
in 1843. This house having been the residence of the Catholic
Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Carpenter, who died there a few
years previously, was regarded reverentially by the survivors
of his flock.</p>

<p>'Will no one urge Lord Edward to fly&mdash;I pledge myself
that every port in the kingdom shall be left open to him'&mdash;said
Lord Chancellor Clare. But money was to be made of
his blood; and vampire instincts must needs be sated. The
arrest was not effected until Saturday, May 19, although a
proclamation promising 1,000<em>l.</em> as its price had been out since
March.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Higgins, who constantly transmitted the result of his
espionage to Dublin Castle, was now more than ordinarily on
the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>. At Moira House, Usher's Island, Pamela, wife
of Lord Edward, sometimes stayed. In March, Leinster
House, Kildare Street, was searched by soldiers&mdash;on which
occasion Major Swan said to Lady Edward: 'This is an
unpleasant duty for any gentleman to perform.'&mdash;'It is a task
which no gentleman <em>would</em> perform,' was the reply.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> She
little dreamed that men whose friendship she valued were
playing a part still more ungentlemanly. On this occasion
Lord Edward narrowly escaped; thenceforth he avoided both
Leinster House and Moira House, unless for stealthy visits,
and for weeks he remained hidden at Portobello near
Dublin.</p>

<p>Thomas Moore, when engaged on the 'Life of Lord
Edward,' had an interview with Major Sirr, and learned from
him that on May 17,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> 1798, 'he received information that a
party of persons, supposed to be Lord Edward Fitzgerald's
bodyguard, would be on their way from Thomas Street to
Usher's Island that night.' Their destination, Moore adds,
he had failed to discover. I am in a position to show, however,
that the party were on their way to the house of Francis
Magan and his sister, in Usher's Island. Mr. James Moore,
of 119 Thomas Street, had given Lord Edward shelter when
1,000<em>l.</em> lay on his head; but a carpenter named Tuite&mdash;who
worked in Dublin Castle, and knew Moore&mdash;having overheard
Cooke say that Moore's house should be searched, gave a
timely hint to Moore, who therefore fled to Meath, previously
telling his daughter to provide for Lord Edward's safety.
Francis Magan and his sister were well known and respected
by Miss Moore. She conferred with Magan on the subject,
and an arrangement was made that Lord Edward should
move that night from Moore's in Thomas Street to Usher's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Island and occupy a bedroom in Magan's house.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> But it was
suggested that, as two or three people knocking at his hall
door on Usher's Island might attract attention, it would be
safer to admit them by his stable in Island Street, which lay
immediately at the rear. The biographer of Lord Edward
knew nothing of Miss Moore's arrangement with Magan; but
he casually mentions that the Government received information
of his lordship's intended visit to Usher's Island. Major
Sirr, attended by a guard, proceeded to the quarter pointed
out; a conflict between the parties took place; 'and,' adds
the biographer, 'Sirr in defending himself lost his footing and
fell; and had not those with whom he was engaged been much
more occupied with their noble charge than with him, he could
hardly have escaped. But their chief object being Lord
Edward's safety, after snapping a pistol or two at Sirr they
hurried away.'<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Several volumes containing the original correspondence of
Major Sirr are now preserved in the library of Trinity College,
Dublin. Amongst them is the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lord Edward will be this evening<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> in Watling Street. Place a
watch in Watling Street, two houses up from Usher's Island,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
another towards Queen's Bridge;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> a third in Island Street, at the
rear of the stables near Watling Street, and which leads up to
Thomas Street and Dirty Lane. At one of these places Lord
Edward will be found, and will have one or two with him. They
may be armed. Send to Swan and Atkinson as soon as you can.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Edward Cooke.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Cooke, with due consideration for the feelings of Magan and
Higgins, does not tell Sirr from whom the information came;
but the plot now thickens, and will be soon made clear.</p>

<p>Miss Moore&mdash;afterwards Mrs. Macready&mdash;died in 1844.
To her son, she said:&mdash;'The Government got timely information
that we were going to Usher's Island. Now this intention
was known only to Magan and me; even Lord Edward did not
know our destination until just before starting. If Magan is
innocent, then I am the informer.'</p>

<p>On the day after Magan's apparently humane arrangement
with Miss Moore he called at her house, anxiously
inquiring if aught had happened, as he had waited up until
the small hours, and yet Lord Edward did not come! Miss
Moore, not suspecting Magan, replied: 'We were stopped in
Watling Street; we hurried back to Thomas Street, where we
providentially succeeded in getting Lord Edward a room at
Murphy's.' Mr. Magan, satisfied by the explanation, leisurely
withdrew, but, no doubt, quickened his gait on reaching the
street. That evening, at four o'clock, Murphy's house was
surrounded by soldiers, and Lord Edward, after a desperate
resistance, was secured, and conveyed in a sedan-chair to
the Castle.</p>

<p>Higgins claimed, and received, 1,000<em>l.</em> as the price. How
much was given by him to the 'setter,' or what precise agreement
subsisted between them, I have no document to show.
A pension was bestowed upon Magan, and I find in the Secret
Service account the following entry: 'September 11, 1800&mdash;Magan,
per Mr. Higgins, 300<em>l.</em>'</p>

<p>The name of Thomas Magan, the father of the betrayer, disappears
from the Directory in 1797&mdash;from which I, at first,
inferred that his death occurred about that time. But it now
appears that he subsided into bankruptcy. On May 2, 1798,
the assignees of Thomas Magan, woollen-draper, a bankrupt,
grant to John Corballis, for the consideration of 690<em>l.</em>, some
house property belonging to Magan.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> This date is worthy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>attention; it is one fortnight before the arrest of Lord Edward
Fitzgerald. The difficulties of the Magan family had been
gathering for some years. They commenced in 1793, when
Higgins lent Thomas Magan 1,000<em>l.</em>; and three years later, as
will be seen, another thousand. 'The borrower is servant
to the lender,' saith the proverb. Further search in the
Registry of Deeds Office, Dublin, discloses two additional
mortgages from Thomas Magan, senior, to Francis Higgins&mdash;one
for 2,341<em>l.</em>, another for 1,000<em>l.</em> The 'witness is
Francis Magan.'<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Their date is July 7, 1796, when very
serious embarrassments threatened the family. How closely
Shamado's toils<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> grasped father and son is now clear;
and let us hope that when Francis Magan was persuaded by
his tempter to sell Lord Edward's blood, he muttered, not
without emotion, 'My poverty, and not my will, consents.'<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The name 'James Dixon' appears in the private list, supplied
by Mr. Froude, of those who constituted the executive
Committee of the United Irishmen in 1795, and 'by whom the
whole organisation was managed.' Dr. Madden does not seem
to know this, and says merely<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> that 'James Dickson hospitably
treated and succoured on all occasions the families of the
State prisoners.' The late Mathias O'Kelly told me that one
of the few persons with whom Magan lived, in early life, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>terms of intimacy was 'James Dickson, of Kilmainham,' and
that he had repeatedly met Magan at Dixon's house. 'Dixon
was deeper in the confidence of the rebel party than many more
prominent leaders,' adds O'Kelly. 'He took the chair at the
meeting of United Irishmen which had been convened to thank
Napper Tandy for challenging Attorney-General Toler, afterwards
Lord Norbury; and he was twice imprisoned for
alleged complicity in the rebellion.' But the Government
treated him with a consideration extended to few others;
and, on the grounds of ill-health, he was permitted to leave
Kilmainham Gaol daily on short riding excursions.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Undemonstrative in his habits, it is not easy to trace him
in the scanty reports of contemporary newspapers. On May
17, 1797, a meeting of barristers was held urging the
Government to 'yield to the moderate wishes of the people,
and thereby defeat the designs of any party dangerous to the
country;' and amongst the seventy-three signatories, with
Francis Magan, were T. A. Emmet, H. Sheares (afterwards
hanged), Robert Orr, B. B. Harvey (commander at Vinegar
Hill in '98, and also hanged), W. Sampson, Robert Holmes,
J. Philpot Curran, L. McNally, and many other popular men,
some recognised as members of the United Irish Society, such
as Joseph Huband, and W. Newton Bennett, afterwards a
chief justice.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The subsequent Baron, Smith, is there too
with Robert Johnson, dismissed from the bench in 1806, and
George Ponsonby, afterwards Lord Chancellor. In 1797 they
stood upon a pitfall, but by a miracle escaped.</p>

<p>Francis Magan posed through life as the pink of propriety.
Before the last century closed he had strong claims for secret
service; but I cannot doubt, knowing his quiet and somewhat
nervous nature, that whatever information he gave must have
been communicated through Higgins. The latter owned a
newspaper, which was the openly subsidised organ of the
Government. He constantly assailed the popular party with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>invective; so that, unless through Magan, he could have had
no opportunity of approaching the patriots, much less sucking
their brains.</p>

<p>My contention as regards Magan was first expressed in a
'Note on the Cornwallis Papers' printed thirty years ago,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and
it is with no small interest that I now find all my suspicions
confirmed by Magan's own letters. The letters of Higgins to
Cooke claiming blood-money for Magan form the crowning
proof of that which at first was mere theory. Magan was an
informer of the most mercenary type&mdash;constantly tendering
his services, and withholding information when coin ceased to
clink.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of Magan by name is in 1797; the
reports of Higgins are specially full at that date, no doubt
the fruit of intercourse with Magan, who was completely his
creature. One, undated, says: 'On Wednesday last, Jackson,
Dixon, Magan, and a large party dined at McKinley's, opposite
Kilmainham Gaol. The two first went into the prison, and
distributed money which the prisoners had wrote for.'</p>

<p>Many letters follow. Higgins told enough to show how
important a spy Magan could become if betrayal were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
worth his while. On December 29, 1797, he writes: 'You
have not, dear Sir, determined as to M. At such a momentous
and critical period ... every intelligence should be obtained
for Government.'<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>But is the proof certain that 'M.' means Magan? Higgins
four days later returns to the charge, adding: 'You have said
nothing about Magan, and will let his information slip through
your hands, as he is about to go down to Belfast, and thence
to England.'<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Higgins and Magan, strange to say, did not know that the
democratic barrister, McNally, was already in pay as a spy.
Part of the information furnished concerns McNally's movements,
which may have made Cooke indifferent as regards
some of the letters. Higgins, on January 3, 1798, reports
that at the pillorying of Finnerty, Lord Edward, O'Connor,
Bond, Sheares and McNally attended the rebel as a mark of
sympathy. Magan was hungry for Lord Edward's blood;
and Cooke must needs be brought at once to business. On
January 5, 1798, Higgins says he will 'fix Magan to meet
Cooke at dinner,' and 'shall in the course of to-day or to-morrow
give you a hint of his terms.'</p>

<p>The dinner did its work. The ill-fated priest O'Coigly&mdash;or
Quigly&mdash;was now 'wanted,' but meanwhile other wants
must needs be satisfied.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. wants money, and I am sure will serve your intention
[Higgins writes]; let him have it, and I will bring you his receipt.
I shall also send him in quest of Quigly.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Permit me, however, to
mention that you have not half sufficiently examined M. I shall,
therefore, set down an outline for you, or obtain him to attend when
you can be more particular.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p></div>

<p>Four days later he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. dines with Jackson,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> etc., to-morrow. He promises to have
many particulars. Two days before O'Connor sailed for England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>M&mdash;&mdash;, Emmet, and Lord Edward Fitzgerald dined with Fallon on
settling a plan as to Galway. Fallon is a man of property.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p></div>

<p>A bundle of letters covering six weeks follows. Magan
feigned to be the attached friend of his victims, and was so
entirely trusted that they resolved to give him higher office in
the rebel executive.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. wishes you to send wt [what] was promised on the 28th.
He is to be elected into office.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p></div>

<p>A letter dated March 7, 1798, contains a long account
from Magan, through Higgins, regarding persons from Belfast
and Wexford, recently forming deputations from their committees.
'He is to be with me at 12 o'clock to-morrow. I
request you will be so good as to recollect sending to me for
him as promised.' Magan was duly pumped, and Higgins, on
March 15, writes: 'M. was with me this day, and seemed
as if I had received a second 100<em>l.</em> for him. For God's sake
send it, and don't let me appear in so awkward a situation.'
And on March 23, 1798, Higgins writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. became quite offended that I did not send wt was promised.
He has not communicated anything to me for the ten days past,
tho I know he must have much information to give in.</p></div>

<p>The money was sent, and Magan's tattle was resumed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This night there is to be a meeting at Lawless's.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> I shall learn
to-morrow the nature of it. I would wish to put you in possession
of something M. knows of, that you may ask and interrogate him
about them, and let him agree to come to a fixed point of information.
I know it is (or will be from his late election) in his power.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p></div>

<p>Raised to a post of trust and authority in the organisation,
Magan's power of betrayal became, of course, largely increased.
He had hitherto communicated solely through Higgins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Stimulated by reward, he now addressed Cooke direct, but
anonymously. Cooke, however, has endorsed the letter 'Mag.'
It is dated not from Usher's Island, where he lived, but from
Higgins' house in Stephen's Green, and the handwriting is
the same as that in a later document with an acknowledged
signature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I did not receive your promised favour till Easter Monday last,
and on reading your letter requested Mr. H. to know your leisure
for an interview.... He wrote me a most pressing letter not to
leave town.... At the risk of my personal safety I accompanied
him in a carriage to your door.... I have <em>all along</em> had in contemplation
to put you in possession of some act that would essentially
serve the Government as well as the country, and it may not
be very long till such is effected. At present perhaps you may not
know that Lord Edward lurks about town and its vicinity; he with
Nelson was a few days ago in the custody of a patrol in the neighbourhood
of Lucan, but not being known and assuming other names,
they were not detained for any length of time.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Nelson is now the
most active man, and affects, if he really does not hold, the first
situation. For my part I sometimes imagine he is the person that
communicated with Government; however, suspicion has not
pointed at him.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> His absence, I know, at the present moment
would be considered as very fatal to the cause in Dublin. I have
just this moment heard Lord Edward has been mostly in Thomas
Street.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p></div>

<p>On May Day 1798, when boys and girls were rejoicing,
and the May-pole at Finglas was the scene of a festivity in
glad welcome of the coming flowers, Higgins writes in great
fuss to Cooke that a more formidable rising was at hand,
adding: 'If you can see M. this night, you can bring out
where Lord Edward is concealed.' 'What hour shall I bring
M. this night, if your leisure will permit? Remember to bring
him to a point&mdash;I mean about Lord Edward.' But his lordship's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>frequent change of abode baulked the projected capture. Mr.
Lecky considers that the search must have been made with
singular languor to produce such little fruit. It should be
remembered, however, that no police force deserving the name
existed in Dublin; and that arrests were usually made, as
eventually in Lord Edward's case, by detachments of military.</p>

<p>On May 15 Higgins wrote to Cooke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. seems mortified that when he placed matters within the
reach of Government the opportunity was neglected.... Lord
Edward skulks from house to house&mdash;has watches and spies around
who give an account of any danger being near. It is intended he
shall go into the country (it is thought Kildare) and make a rising.
Give me leave to remind you of sending to M.</p></div>

<p>Magan is shown to have met Lord Edward at council
at this time, but it was not easy to seize the chief on such
occasions. Higgins was the Castle journalist, and could throw
off letters with ease. Mr. Lecky says that his missives to Cooke
would be found most useful material in illustrating the history
of his time; and, no doubt, they are destined some day to see
the light. Higgins uniformly writes of Lord Edward as a
monster of evil, but it is due to the ill-fated Geraldine to say
that men whose testimony ranks far higher record a different
estimate.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Lord Holland, a Cabinet minister, thus writes of
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>More than twenty years have now passed away. Many of my
political opinions are softened&mdash;my predilections for some men
weakened, my prejudices against others removed; but my approbation
of Lord Edward Fitzgerald's actions remains unaltered and
unshaken. His country was bleeding under one of the hardest
tyrannies that our times have witnessed.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>If he had personal ambition to gratify, the powerful influence
of his family could easily have fed it to repletion. His life
was one of sacrifice and attests the sincerity of his soul.</p>

<p>Higgins thought that Cooke was not sufficiently alive to
the importance of Magan's hints. He now tells Cooke that
an attack on Dublin Castle had been proposed and adopted,
but this information may have been embellished to rouse the
Irish Government. 'M. thinks it is on the ensuing Tuesday
or Wednesday, but will be certain for your information,' he
writes. 'He says the 300<em>l.</em> promised should have been given at
once.... However, I have given him leave to draw upon me,
and fully satisfied him of the honourable intentions of Government
where service was actually performed, and of your kind
attention if he would go forward among the meetings, communicate
what is transacting, and, if found necessary, point
out the spot where they may be seized, etc. This he has at
length agreed to do.'<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The reader will remember Magan's arrangement with Miss
Moore that, for Lord Edward's greater safety, the noble fugitive
was to shift his quarters from James Moore's house to
Magan's. The latter, to screen himself from suspicion, felt
anxious that Lord Edward's capture should be made in the
street.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... I also mentioned your kind promise of obtaining 1000<em>l.</em> for
him (without the mention of his name or enrolment of it in any
book) on having the business done, which he pointed out before the
issuing of the proclamation. He, therefore, puts himself on your
honour not to admit of any person to come and search his house
(which I ventured to promise you would have observed), but to
place watches after dusk, this night near the end of Watling Street
or two houses up in that street from Usher's Island ... [here the
pith of Mr. Cooke's letter, see p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a> <i lang="la">ante</i>, is given], and at one of
these places they will find Lord Edward disguised. He wears a
wig and may have been otherwise metamorphosed, attended by one
or two, but followed by several armed banditti with new daggers.
He intends to give battle if not suddenly seized.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>The 'armed banditti' consisted merely of Mrs. and Miss
Moore, Gallagher, a clerk in Moore's employ, and a man
named Palmer.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> This is the account furnished to me in a
most circumstantial statement by the late Mr. Macready, the
son of Miss Moore. She had been educated in Tours; Lord
Edward always conversed with her in French, and he usually
passed as her French tutor. The hour was 8.30 in a lovely
May evening. Palmer and Gallagher walked some yards in
advance, and were the first to come in contact with Sirr's
party at the corner of Island Street. Sirr gave Gallagher an
ugly wound which afterwards favoured identification. The
latter, a powerful man, made two or three stabs at Sirr, who
fell in the struggle, but, as he wore a coat of mail, he was
able, after a few moments, to regain his feet. Lord Edward
was also in handigrips with one of Sirr's guard; both came
to the ground, but with no more ill result to his lordship than
some unsightly daubs of mud on his coat. In the confusion
the ladies hurried back with their noble charge to Thomas
Street, leaving Palmer and Gallagher to hold Sirr at bay.
The party abandoned their design of going to Magan's, though
not from any distrust of his fidelity, and obtained shelter for
Lord Edward in the house of a faithful adherent named
Murphy with whom he had previously stayed. Miss Moore
told Magan next day the whole adventure, and how the retreat
had been safely effected. Lord Edward was lying on his
bed in Murphy's attic, after having drunk some whey to relieve
a bad cold, when Major Swan and Captain Ryan peeped in at
the door, exclaiming that resistance would be vain. At once
Fitzgerald started up like a lion from his lair and rushed at
Swan. Revolvers were as yet unknown and his pistol missed
fire; he then drew a dagger. The account furnished by
Swan to a Government print states:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His lordship then closed upon Mr. Swan, shortened the dagger,
and gave him a stab in the side, under the left arm and breast,
having first changed it from one hand to the other over his shoulder
(as Mr. Swan thinks). Finding the blood running from him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>the impossibility to restrain him, he was compelled, in defence of
his life, to discharge a double-barrelled pistol at his lordship, which
wounded him in the shoulder: he fell on the bed, but, recovering
himself, ran at him with the dagger, which Mr. Swan caught by
the blade with one hand, and endeavoured to trip him up.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p></div>

<p>Captain Ryan then came upon the scene, but his flint lock
missed fire; and thereupon he lurched at Lord Edward with
a sword-cane, which bent on his ribs. Sirr had been engaged
in placing pickets round the house, when the report of Swan's
pistol brought him upstairs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On my arrival in view of Lord Edward, Ryan, and Swan [writes
Major Sirr, in a letter addressed to Ryan's son], I beheld his lordship
standing with a dagger in his hand as if ready to plunge it into my
friends, while dear Ryan, seated on the bottom step of the flight of
the upper stairs, had Lord Edward grasped with both his arms by
the legs or thighs, and Swan in a somewhat similar situation, both
labouring under the torment of their wounds, when, without hesitation,
I fired at Lord Edward's dagger arm, and the instrument of
death fell to the ground. Having secured the titled prisoner, my
first concern was for your dear father's safety. I viewed his intestines
with grief and sorrow.</p></div>

<p>Lord Edward, in fact, had completely ripped him open.
Although Sirr had lodged several slugs in his lordship's right
shoulder, he continued to fight furiously until the soldiers, of
whom more than 200 were present, overwhelmed him by
pressing their heavy firelocks across his person. They had
brought him as far as the hall, when he made another desperate
effort to escape, and a drummer from behind stabbed him in
the neck.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Previous to this scene Higgins plied Cooke with
gossip from Magan, as the case about to be cited will show.</p>

<p>The nickname applied to Pamela in the following extract
was due to a popular rumour that her parents were Madame
de Genlis and Philippe Egalit√©, Duke of Orleans: 'Lady
Egality complains dreadfully about Lord Castlereagh ordering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>a short passport. She will have letters sewed or quilted in
her clothes, and goes to Hamburg. I shall send you particulars.'<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Lady Fitzgerald was at this time at Moira House, within
a few doors of Magan; and the concluding words go to
show that he had access to the house, and was entirely conversant
with its domestic doings; the status, politics and
attainments of so near a neighbour would facilitate access to
its gilded salons.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Lord Edward probably sent, through
Magan, messages to Pamela. Magan acted his part so plausibly
that on the very night Lord Edward lay a bleeding captive in
Newgate, he was raised by the votes of United Irishmen to a
still higher post in the organisation.</p>

<p>Lord Edward had been arrested in Murphy's house; and
Mr. Lecky remarks<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> that there is no mention of the place in the
letters of Higgins. The latter, to save time, may have given
the hint orally. Higgins resided within twelve minutes' walk
of Cooke's office. Mr. Lecky states:<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> 'He [Higgins] was
accustomed to go openly and frequently to the Castle.' Cooke
told Sirr that if he would go on the following day, between
five and six <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, to the house of Murphy in Thomas Street,
he would find Lord Edward there.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>On May 20, when Lord Edward was dying of his wounds
in Newgate, Magan furnishes through Higgins fresh hints, and
promises further information 'to-morrow.' 'He was elected
last night of the committee,' adds Higgins. 'I had a great deal
of exertion to go through to keep him steady, and was obliged
last week to advance him money.' On June 8 Higgins
writes: 'I cannot get from M. a single sentence of who
assumes a Directory. I have so frequently put him off about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>the payment of the 1,000<em>l.</em> that he thinks I am humbugging
him.'<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that, according to a secret entry of
Cooke's, 1,000<em>l.</em> was paid on June 20 to 'F. H.' for the discovery
of 'L. E. F.,' and he observed the compact that Magan's
name should not appear. Magan thought that there was an
effort to 'humbug' him as regards the blood-money which he
earned, but he knew how to 'humbug' a little himself.
Higgins, setting forth his own claims, tells Cooke, later on:
'By your interference Mr. M. obtained 300<em>l.</em> for expenses;
give me leave solemnly to assure you that I paid every possible
expense he was at, and more than I can mention.'<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Magan was one of the first Catholic barristers called after
the Relief Bill of 1793, and wore an aspect highly demure and
proper. He was a trump card in the hands of Higgins, which,
if adroitly played, could not fail to clear the board. But with
what a small share of the winnings Magan was content is
consistent with all we know of his crawling career.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Arthur
O'Connor, writing to Dr. Madden in 1842, says: 'So far as
I could learn, no one betrayed Lord Edward'&mdash;a striking
testimony to the secrecy with which the thing was done.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Magan, the better to cloak his treachery, and to command
that confidence the fruit of which was distilled into dainty
drops for Cooke's ear, continued to manifest popular sympathies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>He went further, and on December 9, 1798, is found
taking part against the Government in a debate and division,
where his feeble voice could carry no influence, unless to
deceive democratic friends. It was on the occasion of the bar
meeting, in Dublin, convened to discuss and oppose the
Legislative Union. Francis Magan's name may be found on
the patriotic side, in company with Bushe, Burton, Barrington,
Burrowes, Curran, Fletcher, Plunket, Ponsonby, and Leonard
McNally.</p>

<p>Passing on to 1802, we find a round sum of 500<em>l.</em> slipped
into the hands of Francis Magan on December 15 in that year,
as appears by 'an account of Secret Service money applied in
the detection of treasonable conspiracies.' This is the same
amount which was given in 1848 for the discovery of
Smith O'Brien, and again in September 1865 for Stephens,
the Fenian head centre; while in 1798 only 300<em>l.</em> was offered
for Neilson and General Lawless. The discovery which earned
the reward of 500<em>l.</em> in December 1803 must have been
esteemed of importance. What that discovery was has
been hitherto involved in mystery; but the succeeding
chapter, devoted to William Todd Jones, may help to make
it clear. The 500<em>l.</em> is given to Magan direct, nearly eleven
months after the death of Higgins, through whom Magan's
information had been previously conveyed to Dublin Castle.
He was now thrown on his own resources, and seems to have
been less squeamish than of yore. Were Higgins then living
the refresher might have been less, for 'Shamado' had no
objection to a lion's share. And one is not surprised to read
in Plowden that Higgins, originally a pauper, died worth
40,000<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Magan continued successfully to preserve his mask. A
great aggregate meeting was held on December 18, 1812, to
protest against acts of the Irish Government, and among the
signatures convening it are those of Daniel O'Connell and
Francis Magan. This fact is brought out in a memoir of the
Liberator by his son, who, however, does not suspect Magan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a national crisis. Meetings in aid of Catholic
Emancipation had just been forcibly dispersed. Lords Fingall,
Netterville, and Ffrench were dragged from the seats in which,
as chairmen, they presided. Other signatories who, with
Magan, convened this meeting, were the three Catholic peers
just mentioned, Dr. T. Dromgoole, Bernard Coyle, Sylvester
Costigan, Con McLoughlin, and Fitzgerald of Geraldine&mdash;the
latter five having been, as well as O'Connell, United Irishmen.</p>

<p>I was not surprised to hear from Mathias O'Kelly,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> an old
member of the Catholic Board and at one time secretary to
the Catholic Association, that Magan possessed the respect
and confidence of those bodies. He seemed to prove the sincerity
of his sympathy in the most practical way, and rarely
gave less than ten pounds as a subscription to their funds.
It is, no doubt, to Magan that Wellington refers in his letter
to Dublin Castle, dated London, November 17, 1808: 'I think
that, as there are some interesting Catholic questions afloat
now, you might feed &mdash;&mdash; with another 100<em>l.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Dirham, who from his boyhood had resided on Usher's
Island, heard it rumoured, he told me, that Magan during the
troubled times kept frequently open the door of his stable in
Island Street to facilitate espionage.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Moira House, now the
'Mendicity Institution,' is situated within a few doors of No.
20, Usher's Island, the residence for half a century of Francis
Magan. As already mentioned, Pamela, the beautiful wife of
Lord Edward Fitzgerald, received in the stormy period of '98
hospitable shelter from Lady Moira. To my surprise I find,
in a manuscript life of Dwyer the outlaw, by the late Luke
Cullen, a Carmelite friar, that two of Emmet's most active
emissaries, Wylde and Mahon, lay concealed in Moira House
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>while a proclamation offering 500<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> for their capture was being
widely circulated. Before this curious fact came to my knowledge,
it will be seen, from a former work of mine dealing with
informers, that on utterly distinct circumstantial evidence I
sought to trace Magan as on the track of Wylde and Mahon at
Philipstown during the same eventful year.</p>

<p>Major Sirr made a private note, which remains duly on
record<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> that the retreat of Wylde and Mahon 'is sometimes at
the gaoler's in Philipstown, who is married to Wylde's sister.'
The following entry appears in the 'account of secret service
money employed in detecting treasonable conspiracies per
affidavit of Mr. Cooke': 'April 2, 1803. Francis Magan, by
post to Philipstown&mdash;100<em>l.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>In the State Papers of the time I can find no letters
bearing on this transaction, and therefore I must seek to
trace it on circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Who can doubt that Magan, when a refresher reached him
at Philipstown, was in hot scent after Wylde and Mahon?
Later on, during the same year, we find Captain Caulfield
and a party of military laying siege to the house at Philipstown
in which Wylde and Mahon were suspected to be concealed.
An account of a skirmish is supplied by Captain Caulfield
in a letter, dated December 17, 1803, also preserved in
the Sirr papers: 'Captain Dodgson was killed, and,' adds
Caulfield, 'we were obliged to retire, while the villains made
their escape.'<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Luke Cullen, the Carmelite already referred to, spent his
later life gathering from the peasantry their recollections of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>troubled times. His manuscript life of Dwyer has been placed
in my hands by the superior of Clondalkin monastery. Folios
595 to 597 describe Wylde and Mahon's refuge at Philipstown,
the abortive efforts to catch them there, and afterwards
their concealment at Moira House, Dublin. The governor of
Philipstown Gaol, we learn, was a near connection of both.
They are stated by Cullen to have at last effected their escape
from Moira House, Usher's Island, in a boat which rapidly
passed out of the bay. Having reached the United States,
Wylde and Mahon joined the army, and found speedy promotion.
The statement that two proscribed men, most active
propagandists of Emmet's plans, lay under Lord Moira's √¶gis
seems startling; but this statesman and his countess had very
popular sympathies, and liked to succour rebels. The late
Mr. Thomas Geoghegan, solicitor, informed me that two
uncles of his named Clements, who were United Irishmen,
obtained refuge at Moira House while warrants were out for
their arrest, and finally succeeded in escaping all pains and
penalties owing to the precautions taken by Lady Moira.</p>

<p>It is not a little singular that General Lord Moira, who,
later on, was offered the Viceroyalties of Ireland and of India,
and who in 1812, on the death of Percival, sought to form an
administration, should have performed the perilous task of
harbouring men who loved Ireland 'not wisely, but too well.'
Portland, in a letter to Camden, dated 11 March, 1798, classes
with 'the disaffected,' 'Lord Moira and his adherents.' This
impression was partly due to his indignant protest in Parliament
against that policy of torture by which the people had
been daily goaded to rebel.</p>

<p>Magan's life involved some strange contradictions. Proud,
and even haughty, he yet hesitated not to commit base acts;
with the wages of dishonour he paid his just debts. An interesting
letter, in reply to a query, was addressed to the present
writer by the late John Fetherstonhaugh, of Griffinstown,
Kinnegad. His grandfather, Thomas Fetherston, of Bracket
Castle, was, he states, in the habit for years of lodging in
High Street, Dublin, at the house of Thomas Magan, a draper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
'and departed this life in his house.'<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Fetherston's son, on
inspecting his papers, found a joint bond from the draper and
his son, Francis Magan, for 1,000<em>l.</em>, and on speaking to the
former respecting its payment, he declared that he was
insolvent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So my father [adds Mr. Fetherston] put it into his desk, counting
it waste paper. Some years elapsed and the son came to Bracket
Castle, my father's residence, and asked for the bond. 'For what?'
said my father. To his astonishment, he said it was to pay it.
I was then but a boy, but I can now almost see the strange scene&mdash;it
made so great an impression on me. Often my father told me
Magan paid the 1,000<em>l.</em>, and he could not conceive where he got it,
as he never held a brief in court; and he was always puzzled why
the Crown gave him place and pension.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p></div>

<p>James Dickson of Kilmainham has been more than once
mentioned in these pages. As soon as he had been discharged
from gaol, in the absence of evidence to convict him in a court
of law, he opened his house for the entertainment and solace
of the families of the State prisoners. But his guests were
not confined wholly to the United Brotherhood. My informant,
the late Mathias O'Kelly, often met there William Todd
Jones, of whose arrest in 1803, on suspicion of complicity in
Emmet's treason, volumes were published; Lord Kingsland,
famous for a career of marvellous vicissitude; Mrs. Neilson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>wife of the rebel leader, then imprisoned at Fort George; and
Plowden, the popular historian, who gathered at Dickson's
table much valuable information. The house was quite a
centre of liberal opinion in Dublin, and no man shared
Dickson's confidence more fully than Magan. Mathias O'Kelly
greatly respected Magan, and thirty years ago, when I first
started my suspicion, he laboured hard to convince me that I
was entirely wrong. Magan told O'Kelly that he had been a
member of the Society of United Irishmen, but withdrew from
it when he saw it drifting into dangerous courses. The
reverse is the fact. He played his part so well that at the time
of his betrayals he was promoted to a high post in the rebel
executive.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>In 1832 a brochure was 'printed for the author by
William Shaw, Dublin,' which must have quickened the
sluggish pulse of Mr. and Miss Magan. It was 'An Impartial
Enquiry respecting the Betrayal of Lord Edward Fitzgerald,' by
Joseph Hamilton. No charge was preferred against the Magans
in this pamphlet. But conscience makes cowards; the probing
given to a sore spot, and Hamilton's mention of 'Mr. Magan and
his sister,' with others who knew of Lord Edward's movements
previous to the arrest, proved distasteful at 20 Usher's Island.</p>

<p>Hamilton's labour was undertaken with the avowed object
of clearing Neilson from a suspicion which Moore, in his Memoir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of Lord Edward, ventured to start. Whether Moore, in gathering
facts for his book, had been referred to the Magans, I know
not, but he certainly returned to England strongly prejudiced
against the incorruptible Neilson, and straightway framed an
indictment bristling with innuendos.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Hamilton prints, with
other vindicatory papers, letters from Hamilton Rowan and
Dr. McNevin, also a touching protest from the daughter of
Neilson. Hamilton knew Lord Edward well.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dearer to me was Edward's life than Neilson's memory [he
writes]. Dearer to me is Ireland than are Neilson's children and
his friends. If I thought he was the man who could betray his
generous friend and noble chieftain, I would leave his memory and
his bones to rot together. I took up his vindication, not as a partial
advocate; and in thus conducting his defence I will not endeavour
to suppress a single fact which might go to justify the accusing
passage in Lord Edward's 'Life.'</p></div>

<p>Mr. Hamilton proved Neilson guiltless, but he fell into the
error, which a man blindfolded at play commits, in very often
making a grasp in the wrong quarter. He suspects Reynolds;
Captain Armstrong, who betrayed Sheares; 'a Mr. Hatton,
one of the rebel Executive, <em>who unaccountably escaped</em>.'<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Even
Sir Jonah Barrington; nay, the estimable philanthropist,
Mathias O'Kelly, who lived with his father at Galway's Walk,
near the scene of Lord Edward's tussle with Sirr, was also
mentioned in a suggestive way. 'On the 17th May,' writes
Hamilton, 'Armstrong met both the Sheares, and on that
evening Major Sirr was seen looking towards the rear of Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Magan's house from Mr. O'Kelly's stable door in Galway's
Walk. I know five different places where Lord Edward was
concealed,' he adds. The secret which, like the sword of
Damocles, had long hung over the heads of Francis Magan
and his sister, now seemed on the point of falling; but their
names were not used in this pamphlet more freely than those
of Miss Moore, Murphy, and a few other persons amongst
whose haunts the Geraldine flitted during his last days in
this world. Hamilton thus closes the first stage of his
inquiry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My documents and anecdotes are every hour increasing. I have
received communications from the wife and son of him with whom
the Major had the struggle near the house of Miss Magan. I call
on Mrs. Moore, Mrs. Dixon,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Mrs. Rowe, and Miss Magan; I call
on Mr. Magan, Mr. Murphy, their families, and all those individuals
who either visited or served them or their noble guest, to tell all
Ireland all they are acquainted with respecting the last week Lord
Edward had his freedom. I know what some of them can say; I
know what more of them might say; and I pause for their full and
faithful declarations.</p></div>

<p>A promised second part never appeared; but it were
almost better for the feelings of Magan and his sister had
the dreaded charge been boldly fulminated, than the agony
of suspense to which they were doomed. I had not seen
this scarce pamphlet when I first expressed my suspicions of
Magan.</p>

<p>When the present century was in its teens, the aristocratic
section of Irish Catholics sought to give the Crown a 'veto'
in the appointment of their bishops, and started in opposition
to O'Connell, who had been demanding unfettered emancipation.
In the ranks of this troublesome schism, the records
of which would fill a library, I find Francis Magan, Lords
Fingall,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Trimleston, Kenmare, Gormanstown, and Southwell,

others anxious to reach by a short cut the good things of the
State.</p>

<p>The gentleman into whose hands Magan's papers passed
tells me that he found a letter addressed to him in 1834 by
Sir W. Gossett, Assistant Secretary of State at Dublin Castle,
asking under what circumstances he claimed a pension from
the Crown, and requesting information as to a small office he
held. A copy of Magan's reply was appended, saying that the
Viceroy of the day had promised him a county chairmanship&mdash;or,
as it would now be called, a county court judgeship; but,
owing to the disabilities then affecting Catholics, he was found
to be not eligible for appointment, and the emoluments in
question were given as compensation.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Gossett had succeeded
Gregory in 1831, and having come in with the Whigs sought
to administer a more liberal form of government. Cornwallis,
Castlereagh, Cooke and Marsden had been long gone to their
account, and dead men tell no tales. Whether Gossett viewed
Magan's reply as quite satisfactory does not appear. In 1835
Earl Mulgrave deprived Watty Cox of his pension, but I cannot
say whether the same high-handed course was extended to
Magan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Magan was said to have filled some small legal office long
since abolished, though of its precise character even his relatives
could afford no information. A gossiping missive is
subjoined, the less reluctantly because Magan, having often
stood in misanthropic isolation, it is pleasant to find any
person who came in frequent contact with him. Moreover it
is one of the last letters of a not undistinguished man. Sir
W. Gossett, who wrote to Magan for information as regards
the sinecure he held, might have been glad of the dates which
are now supplied. The late Huband Smith, M.R.I.A., served
with Magan as a Commissioner for Enclosing Commons.
This was rather an unpopular appointment. The disturbances
of 1766, ending in the execution of Father Sheehy, all originated
in the resistance offered to a similar measure. From
1821 to 1827 Mr. Goulburn filled the office of Chief Secretary
for Ireland, and he was a very likely man to have recognised
the claims of any person who had rendered secret service in
'98. The same remark applies to the Premier, Lord Liverpool,
who provided so munificently for the family of Reynolds
the informer. On the death of that peer in 1827 his successor,
Mr. Canning, earned popularity by refusing to employ
in his departments any of the spies of '98, or even to ratify
the appointments of Lord Castlereagh or Lord Liverpool.</p>

<p>Huband Smith's letter runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I deferred replying to your note and queries till I could lay my
hands on some documents which I had preserved respecting the
Commission for inclosing Waste Lands and Commons in Tallaght,
Killsillaghan, &amp;c. The Act was passed in the 2nd of George IV.
session of 1821. The original Commissioners were Morgan Crofton,
James Clancy, and Francis Magan, all barristers. The lands to be
inclosed were:&mdash;In Tallaght, 783 acres; Killsillaghan, 150 acres;
Luske, 320 acres exclusive of the racecourse. The Act recited the
owners of the adjoining lands, lords of manors, and also the General
Inclosure Act of 43 George III. The earlier meetings of the Commissioners
were held in the Royal Exchange, and the later ones at
the house of William Duffield Rooke, an eminent solicitor, in Molesworth
Street, well known also in the musical world as an accomplished
violinist, and member of the 'Beef-Steak Club.' Mr. Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Crofton having died in 1830, it became necessary for the surviving
Commissioners under the Act to appoint a third in his place, and in
February 1831 I was sworn in as a Commissioner at the meeting
held on March 11, 1831, and this was the first time I met Magan.
Mr. James Clancy was a barrister of some eminence well known to
the profession by able legal treatises, amongst them one of considerable
authority on the law of husband and wife.</p>

<p>In regard to your query, what was the average amount of the
fees which constituted Magan's salary&mdash;he was entitled to receive
three guineas <i lang="la">per diem</i> for every day on which the Commissioners
sat in furtherance of the Act. Magan and his brother Commissioners
were armed with large powers, such as examining witnesses
on oath, awarding costs, and enforcing payment by distress
warrant, &amp;c. In point of fact they held a sort of court, and constituted
a tribunal from which the appeal lay to the Superior Courts
by action at law, under certain restrictions. The Commissioners
were directed to hold perambulations, and authorised to sell such
parts of the lands as, in their opinion, were necessary to defray the
expenses of passing the Act and of carrying it into execution, and
to execute conveyances of the fee-simple.</p>

<p>It is on the commons at Lusk that the admirable Irish convict
system, which has worked so well, has been fully carried into
operation.</p>

<p>With regard to Magan's manner, it appeared to me very unobtrusive,
and, as one would say, undemonstrative. He was then an
elderly man sufficiently gentlemanlike in appearance, tall, yet rather
of plain, and even coarse exterior; perhaps a little moody and reserved
at times, and something may have been pressing on him of
which he said little.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> As to his private income, there were no data
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>for coming to any conclusion.... He resided at Usher's Island,
near the Four Courts, a neighbourhood at that time inhabited
by a better class than now, and it formed no part of the Commission
to inquire more minutely into his affairs.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Magan was socially described as a person who 'held
his head high,' and with a nice sense of honour. In later
years he seemed unduly sensitive and, at times, retiring.
Possessing few friends through life, he continued staunch to
these few, beginning with Francis Higgins and ending with
'Master' Clancy. 'I hold Magan in such esteem,' the latter
said, 'that only for his advanced age I should like to appoint
him my executor.' Some other men who remembered '98, its
horrors, and its gossip, rather recoiled from Magan without
knowing well why. There was something of a 'Dr. Fell' about
him. He occasionally went the home circuit, but got no briefs.
When hailed by juniors with a deference which put to flight
all misgivings on his part as to whether acquaintanceship
was likely to be valued, his <em>hauteur</em> softened into a dignified
affability, and this relaxation was often taken as a gracious
condescension. His white locks made him venerable, and by
some he was regarded as a father of the Bar.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Another man who viewed him with respect was the late
Judge Corballis, who in reply to a letter wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I never, directly or indirectly, heard anything of the alleged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>charge against Frank Magan during his life. I was on habits of
intimacy with him to the day of his death, and was with him on
his death-bed. He always bore a high character, as far as I could
ever learn, either at the bar or in society.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Corballis lived in the country and knew not what
Magan's neighbours said. In their eyes a black cloud seemed to
hover over his house.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For forty long years, as the neighbours declared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His abode had ne'er once been cleaned or repaired.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>But in personal appearance he was neat enough, and might be
daily seen, in the stiff high cravat of the Regency, emerging
from its precincts. Dr. Atkinson and Charles Kernan say
that, though Magan was a familiar object to them all the year
round, they never saw him accompanied by mortal in his
walks. He never married, would sit in solitude, or stalk
from room to room like Marlay's ghost. Perhaps the voice
of conscience muttered, 'You are said to have sought the confidence
of men in order to betray it; show the world by your
frigid attitude that such is not likely to be true.' He was
reported to have wealth: how he acquired it seemed a
mystery.</p>

<p>In 1842, Dr. Madden, when engaged on his 'Lives of the
United Irishmen,' had interviews, as he tells us, with
Mrs. Macready, who, as Miss Moore, had been with Lord
Edward the day before his arrest;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> but her son informed me
that as Magan was then alive and residing near at hand, she
did not mention his name to Dr. Madden. Magan, however,
cannot fail to have heard of the inquiries being instituted
around him by Madden, and his nervous temperament was not
calmed by that knowledge. He died in 1843, during a period
of great popular excitement and when fears prevailed that the
events of '98 were about to be renewed.</p>

<p>'Magan's remains lie in our vaults' writes a local priest.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>'By his will he requires a perpetual yearly mass to be celebrated
by all priests of this church for the repose of his soul, so that
I have been praying for him once each year since I became
attached to this parish, without knowing anything of his
antecedents.'</p>

<p>Dr. Dirham had been residing within a few doors of
Magan's house, and on the death of that gentleman it occurred
to him to move to the more ample accommodation it afforded.
His account, though wholly unimportant, is curious in its way.
For years Miss Magan kept constantly promising to vacate in
his favour, stating that some small cottage in some rural spot
would be much more suitable to her lonely life; but an irresistible
fascination bound her to the dingy rooms in which
she had vegetated since the dark days of '98. Francis Magan,
by a will of ten lines, had left all his property to Elizabeth,
his sister, and directed that his funeral might be private.
The rooms were now all shut up, and Miss Magan herself ate,
drank, and slept upon the landing. For twenty years the
drawing-room had not been opened, owing to the fact that a
younger sister had died there; and the other apartments of
the house were locked up for reasons equally odd. A
strange indisposition to permit the humblest visitor to enter
the place, was shown in various ways. A quarter of a century
seemed to have elapsed since the dust-pit had been emptied,
and boards were erected round it which enabled the Magans to
add daily <em>d√©bris</em>, until at last they became dust themselves.
When Dr. Dirham came into possession of the place<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> he found
the garden covered from end to end with some feet deep of
cinders, through which rank nettles struggled like the stings
of the self-consciousness that made life with Magan the reverse
of roseate. In a retired nook stood a bottle drainer, the wooden
bars of which had fallen in from decay, smashing in its descent
the emblems of conviviality it once enshrined, and through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>aid of which profitable secrets may erst have been gained.
The sewers and gratings had become choked; and the deep
area at the rear of the house was filled with eight feet of stagnant
water. A subterranean cell, adjoining this fosse, and
by courtesy styled the 'coal-vault,' opened on another dark
chamber; and a feeling of awe crept over the Doctor when,
impelled by curiosity to gauge its depth, he cast a stone
into the pit, and listened until its descent terminated in
the sound of splashing water below. The hinges of the hall
door were so stiff during Miss Magan's tenancy, that Dr. Fleming,
who as a cousin once ventured to visit the moneyed recluse,
had to call at a neighbouring chemist's for sweet oil ere he felt
safe in crying 'Open Sesame.' Seated on the cold landing, in
the midst of chests of mysterious treasure, this 'unprotected
female,' trembling in every nerve lest friends should wrest it
from her grasp, gloomily passed the closing years of a hidden
life. Once, on a false alarm of fire, her anguish was pitiable,
and, to the surprise of everybody, she relinquished the custody
of some chests to a neighbour,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Mr. Cotton, who, however,
detained them only a few hours. At another neighbour's,
Miss Flanagan's, who kept an old established bakery, Miss
Magan always got her bank-notes changed; but, fearful of
being waylaid between the covered car she occupied, and the
door at which it stopped, Miss Flanagan was always obliged
to get into the vehicle and place in the hands of its shrinking
occupant the metallic equivalent for the crisp new note.
Some arrears of rent had accumulated at the time of Miss
Magan's death, and a term of years in the lease remained
unexpired; but her property was so left that the landlord's
claim could not be satisfied. The house was in such a ruined
state that the landlord, Colonel King, was glad to accept half
the former rent. Although an extremely old house, only one
tenant, Archbishop Carpenter,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> occupied it before Magan. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>its back parlour had been ordained Dean Lube and many
other old priests well known in Dublin during the struggle for
Catholic Emancipation; and so searchingly severe was the
operation of penal law, that students for ordination had to
be smuggled into the Archbishop's house by the stable in
Island Street, afterwards turned to ignoble purposes. An
altar stood in a recess of this parlour, which the Magans
changed into a cupboard.</p>

<p>William Allingham would seem to have had the house in
his eye when, some years later, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>On consulting the records of the Probate Court early in
this inquiry, I was puzzled to find that the sum which Miss
Magan appeared to have died worth was quite nominal.
This discovery disturbed, and for some time retarded, the completion
of the chain of evidence. On inquiry, however, it was
stated that, in order to save the legacy duty, she transferred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
when almost <i lang="la">in extremis</i>, a considerable sum to the late Very
Rev. Dr. Taylor and a respected physician<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> still living; and
she made a will ratifying that act. Orally, she expressed a
wish as to its bestowal for some useful purpose, but leaving
details entirely to their discretion. With the bulk of this
money a refuge for penitent females and an asylum for the
insane were built.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Miss Magan died worth 14,000<em>l.</em>, not to
speak of a fee-farm property known as Hartstown, held under
Lord Carhampton, and not far from the Devil's Mills, near
Dublin, which, local tradition states, his lordship built in one
night by demoniac aid.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems strange that Magan, who was insolvent before the
rebellion, could amass so much money. His secret pension
was merely for 200<em>l.</em> a year<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> (a sum insufficient to pay the
rent of his house), give good donations to the Catholic Board,
pay off Fetherston's bond, and support himself, his sisters
and his horse&mdash;for in early life Mr. Magan did indulge in that
luxury. His pension, there is reason to think, from the letter
of Sir William Gossett in 1834, ceased to be paid about that
time. His fees as a Commissioner for enclosing commons were
enjoyed by him for a few years only; and as the 'S.S. Money
Book' records but three payments to him&mdash;namely, on September
11, 1800, April 2, 1802, and December 15, 1802&mdash;it is
evident that he must have derived income from other sources.
There are payments of secret service money to the informers of
'98 and their representatives which obtain no record in the book
ostensibly devoted to that purpose. Captain Armstrong, who
betrayed the Sheares's, is known to have received, throughout
sixty years, about 29,000<em>l.</em> in recognition of that act; and yet
no trace of his name appears in the book of Secret Service
Money expenditure. Money was also obtainable under a
clause in the Act of 39 George III. cap. 65, by which a sum
of 2,910<em>l.</em> was allocated to the Under-Secretary in the Civil department
(Dublin Castle) for the time being, in trust for payment
of secret annuities. A letter from Dr. Ferris suggests
another source. He states, on the authority of a clerk in
Gleadowe Newcomen's Bank, then dead, that an annuity had
been paid from that house to Francis Magan, and that the
clerk had seen Magan's receipts. Dr. Ferris suggests that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>the books of the bank might be still accessible for examination.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>An Act of Parliament provided that the Secret Service
Money placed at the Viceroy's disposal should pass confidentially
through the hands of the Chief Secretary; but this
arrangement has not always been adhered to, as is evident
from the fact that the 1,000<em>l.</em> reward for the discovery of
Emmet was lodged to the credit of the informer in Finlay's
bank. The hint of Dr. Ferris is not uninteresting, but the
books of Newcomen's bank do not seem to have been preserved.
Barrington states that Sir W. Gleadowe Newcomen, who voted
for the Union, received a reward of 20,000<em>l.</em> with a peerage,
and the patronage of his county. It is a strange irony of
fate that Lord Newcomen died poor. For years he lived alone
in the bank, gloating, it was wildly whispered, over ingots
of treasure, with no lamp to guide him but the luminous
diamonds which had been left for safe keeping in his hands.
Moore would have compared him to 'the gloomy gnome that
dwells in the dark gold mine.' Wrapped in a sullen misanthropy,
he was sometimes seen emerging at twilight from
his iron clamped abode. La Touche's bank stood on the
opposite side of Castle Street, and Dublin wags compared
the street to a river because it ran between two banks.
Jokes soon gave way to sobs. One day Newcomen's bank
broke,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> and prosperous men perished in the collapse. Lord
Newcomen had previously retired to Killester, where he died
by his own hand. No claimant appeared for his coronet, and
the line became extinct. This was the twenty-seventh Irish
peerage which had failed since the Union. Gleadowe had
been M.P. for Longford when he voted for the extinction of
the Irish Parliament. Richard Lovel Edgeworth, a betrayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>constituent, regarded this vote as an act of treason, and in
anger shot forth the following bolt:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With a name that is borrowed&mdash;a title that's bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir William would fain be a gentleman thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wit is but cunning, his courage but vapour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pride is but money&mdash;his money but paper!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>What was a pointless sarcasm in 1800 became a stubborn
fact in 1825&mdash;Newcomen's notes were waste paper. The
Hibernian Banking Company soon after began business within
the walls.</p>

of Ecclesiastical History, Trinity College, Dublin, in the <cite>Mail</cite> of October 14,
1885, stated that this pamphlet 'may be found in the library of Trinity College,
Dublin, Gallery H. 10, vol 92.' The brochure had been printed mainly for the
purpose of correcting a mis-statement made by the <cite>Athen√¶um</cite>, when reviewing
the <cite>Cornwallis Papers</cite>. The <cite>Athen√¶um</cite>, then edited by W. Hepworth Dixon,
far from resenting my correction, reviewed the book in terms which stimulated
further efforts, and, if any excuse for them were needed, it is supplied in that
too favourable judgment. See No. 1649 p. 744. 'This biography reads like so
many pages out of Mr. Lever's <cite>Con Cregan, or the Irish Gil Blas</cite>; but Mr. Fitzpatrick
quotes several legal and literary documents to authenticate his text.
Facts in abundance are produced. As illustrative of the state of Irish
political society in those days, this tract is extremely curious. With extraordinary
power of social research, an intimacy is established between the
hateful Higgins and Magan; ... most curious circumstantial evidence,
to criminate Magan. This tract merits preservation. The mass of social
and personal knowledge accumulated by Mr. Fitzpatrick is very striking. He
writes like an <i lang="la">ex post facto</i> Boswell, and the research with which he amasses
minute particulars is a speciality with him. It is for want, heretofore, of
detailed and accurate domestic knowledge, that Irish history is so crude and
colourless; and works like those of Mr. Fitzpatrick have value.'</p></div>

childhood 'Magan' has been to him a familiar household word. His grandfather,
John Brett, lived next door to Magan's house at Usher's Island. Voices,
long since hushed, often described their strange, silent neighbour, of whom it
might be said, 'still waters run deep.' Brett, though not a rebel, had popular
sympathies, and several patriots, including James Tandy, visited at his house.
One day Major Sirr created a great scare at Brett's by instituting a search
for pikes and papers. The hysterics of the young ladies and the protests of
their brothers served only to stimulate his ardour. No nook was left unexplored,
no stone unturned. The intruders even uprooted the flower-beds in the
garden, hoping to make a discovery, but all in vain; and Sirr, with drooping
plumage, at last withdrew.&mdash;See James Tandy's arrest, Appendix, <i lang="la">infra</i>.</p></div>

I reached Philipstown.' On the two previous occasions when Major Sirr
had laid hands on Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the information as we see came

probably of his son, dated 1750. By a deed, dated May 2, 1798, it appears that
James and John Fetherston had been trustees of the will of Mary Magan, the
grandmother of Francis. The property of Papists in penal times was liable to
discovery and forfeiture, and the help of friendly Protestants as trustees sometimes
became a necessity. The first mention of the Magans, and of the
Fetherstons as their trustees, is in 1763.</p></div>

I have 'thrown more light than any other writer on the career of Magan;' and
he quotes the above as 'a very curious fact,' adding that it would be interesting
to know if 'the transaction took place shortly after the death of Lord Edward.'
As satisfaction of the bond might possibly have been 'entered,' I searched the
records of the Four Law Courts, term after term, from 1798 to 1808, but no
trace can be found.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_347_347" id="Footnote_347_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347_347"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> The deliberate and mercenary way in which the respected 'counsellor'
set himself to spy could be shown by fifty letters. Father Quigley, or O'Coigly,
who, it will be remembered, was arrested at Margate in February on Turner's
information (see chap. iii. <i lang="la">ante</i>), and suffered death soon after, escaped by a
hair's breadth the net which Magan had been weaving for his capture in
Dublin. A letter from Higgins to Under-Secretary Cooke, dated 'Stephen's
Green, 12th January, 1798,' goes on to say: 'When I saw M&mdash;&mdash; this day and
just mentioned Quigly's name, he gave me instantly a description of him. Met
him before he went abroad often, and <em>was sheltered in Dixon's house</em>. Will, he
is convinced, find him out. But I beg to recommend a strict watch on Dixon's
and you will instantly discover him.' Four days later, <em>i.e.</em> January 16, 1798,
Higgins tells Cooke, 'M&mdash;&mdash; went several times to Dixon's, but found no trace
of Quigly at his former residence. Neither has he been at Dr. McNevin's. The
only place that he can be sheltered among the party is at Bond's, and which
will be known by Thursday.' Two previous letters, dated October 17, and
October 30, 1797, report very fully Dickson's conversations with Magan.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_348_348" id="Footnote_348_348"></a><a href="#FNanchor_348_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a> Magan, to divert suspicion from himself, may have been the first to set
the story going that Neilson was a base informer. Thomas Moore, after making
inquiries in Dublin, returned home strong in suspicion that Neilson had
betrayed Lord Edward. Magan, in his secret letters of 1798, sometimes seeks
to convey that Neilson was giving information at Dublin Castle. One letter,
dated April 22, 1798, says: 'I sometimes imagine he (Neilson) is the person
who communicated with Government; however, suspicion has not pointed at
him.' Higgins writes (May 15): 'M. says Neilson is playing a double game.'
So faithful did Neilson prove, that Major Sirr discovered him organising a plot
to rescue Lord Edward.</p></div>

then accessible, even to the Irish Government. One of the many letters addressed
by Higgins to Cooke, dated June 30, 1798, refers to the original intent of the
United leaders to rise on May 14. 'Lord Edward was then with Magan, who
found means to prevail on him to postpone his purpose.' The postponement
would give time for the capture of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and others. This
letter was written after the death of the chief, and informs Cooke that 'the plan
<em>was</em> to rise Garretstown, Naul, &amp;c., and circuitously round the metropolis to Dunleary,
&amp;c. Lord Edward insisted on his Kildare men and those of Carlow being
brought in, and he would take the field at Finglas, and march into the city,
which was his great object to carry.' The above is curious as showing how
much Lord Edward's views had changed since Reinhard described him as one
'of the moderate party.'</p></div>

reference to Con Leyne, a wit often named in Moore's <cite>Diary</cite>. The late Rickard
O'Connell, of the Munster Bar, and satellite of the Liberator, wrote, in
reply to some questions, that he had been introduced to Magan at the Four
Courts in 1831 by Maurice King, who said: 'Our young friend can tell you some
good ones as to how Con got on at Darrynane' (Dan's seat); and from time to
time after, as I met Magan in the 'Hall,' there was generally some allusion to
Con, and a chuckle if any fresh story or point against the renowned gastronome
turned up. 'The only members of the Munster Bar I ever saw speaking to
Magan were King, O'Loghlen (Sir M.), Con Leyne, and Howley&mdash;all men
of high honour, who would shun him as a black sheep if they had even a
strong suspicion that he was the character you assume him to be. Usually, he
was rather starched and formal in manner.'</p></div>

a leading terrorist of his time, grants to Francis Higgins part of his
estate of Hartstown and Barnageath; but without mention of trusts or considerations
of any kind. During a law suit which took place in 1802, as Mr. James
Curran, great-grandnephew of Higgins, informs me, it transpired that Higgins,
in this transaction, had been merely trustee for Magan. The freehold conveyed
by Carhampton to Higgins is now in the hands of Magan's legal representative.
I long suspected, but, on full inquiry, have failed to satisfy myself, that Carhampton's
grant to Higgins, in trust for Magan, was part of an arrangement
cunningly devised to baffle suspicion, and meant as an acknowledgment of
private information regarding rebel doings, which Magan, it is certain, was
giving to Higgins; but at least, it proves Carhampton's friendly wish to promote
the interwoven interests of both. On pursuing the labyrinths of the
Registry of Deeds Office, Dublin, I find that the Magans had connection with
the property so far back as 1780. On February 20, 1793, 1000<em>l.</em> was lent by
Higgins to Thomas Magan, the father of Lord Edward's betrayer, charged on
Blackstaheny and Clonsilla, the adjoining lands. Three years later Higgins
tightens his toils, and, as already stated, seeks to further secure this 1000<em>l.</em>
charged on the same property. 'Shamado,' doubtless, well knew how to make
his creature work. The consent to harbour Lord Edward, and the whispered
information as to place and hour would be an easy way of wiping out the debt
for 1000<em>l.</em>, and of currying favour with the lender. I may add that the foregoing
note was written long before I had found the criminatory letters of Higgins
and Magan.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

WILLIAM TODD JONES. EMMET'S REBELLION</h2>


<p>Todd Jones, Wolfe Tone, and Hon. Simon Butler were three
Protestants to whom, Mr. Froude says, the Catholic Committee
voted 1,500<em>l.</em> each, as a reward for their cordially
rendered aid. This was in 1793, and we hear no more of
Todd Jones from Froude. His subsequent history is not without
interest, and seems interwoven with that of Francis
Magan.</p>

<p>John Philpot Curran's writing-desk remains exactly as he
left it when quitting Ireland in 1817 to die. A long and
cautiously written letter,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> without signature, dated August 13,
1803, but known to be from Lady Moira, reposes in this desk.
It was written three weeks after Emmet's rebellion, and a
month prior to his execution. The letter begins mysteriously,
'Read, reflect, but do not answer. Time will unfold the
intentions.' She complains of information which had been
sent to the Government, regarding a trunk, assumed to
be full of papers, reaching Moira House, Usher's Island,
and presumably from Todd Jones. She declares that her
rooms were ransacked, under a warrant from the Secretary
of State, and how letters addressed to Todd Jones at
Moira House had been carried to Dublin Castle. In writing
to Curran, whom she wishes to be her counsel if the matter
should come to trial, she makes light of these letters, and
prudentially describes her correspondence with Jones as mainly
of an antiquarian and picturesque interest.</p>

<p>Magan, who resided within a few doors of Moira House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
possessed peculiar facilities for 'setting'<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> the movements of
its <em>habitu√©s</em>.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> It must have been in 1802 when he was
found by Mathias O'Kelly<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> associating with Todd Jones,
and that date merits attention. 'I had been absent from
Ireland for <em>ten</em> years, from the year 1792,' writes Jones in his
petition to the king, 'during the whole of which period I was
uninterruptedly a resident in England, and in May 1802 I
was indispensably compelled to return to Dublin, by an affair
of honour.'<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Soon after he proceeded to Munster, 'which I
had never beheld, and had long entertained an inclination
to see.'<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>At what date can we trace the first arrival of Jones on
his mysterious mission to Clonakilty, where with several of
his friends he was arrested on a charge of high treason in
July 1803? To that question the answer is, December 1802.
The 'Account of Secret Service Money, applied in detecting
Treasonable Conspiracies,' contains the following entry:&mdash;'1802,
December 15th, Francis Magan, by direction of Mr.
Orpen, 500<em>l.</em>'</p>

<p>There is but one family named 'Orpen' in Ireland; and
the only Orpen who could possibly be authorised to direct the
payment of 500<em>l.</em> to Magan at this time was the High Sheriff
of Cork, in whose bailiwick Jones was tracked and caught.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>Emmet, in his speech from the dock, denied that he was
the life and soul of the conspiracy, as alleged by Mr. Solicitor-General
Plunket; declared that men of greater mark than he
were deep in it; that on his return to Ireland he found
the organisation formed; he was asked to join it; he requested
time to consider; they invited him again, and he embarked in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>the enterprise. And yet, so carefully was the secret kept, that
nothing transpired to show that he had any colleagues of good
position. Lord Norbury, who tried the case, and the Attorney-General
stigmatised the plan as contemptible from the fact
that Emmet's allies were of no higher rank than 'ostlers,
bakers, carpenters, and old clothes men,' and, notwithstanding
the solemnity of Emmet's dying words, history has since given
him the exclusive credit, or discredit, of the rising of 1803.</p>

<p>Among others to whom suspicion attaches, although
there is no absolute evidence to show his guilt, may be
mentioned William Todd Jones, a Protestant of good family
and some means, a barrister and writer, and a member of
the late Irish Parliament. The Viceregal organ, the 'Dublin
Journal,' in its issue of August 6, 1803, after noticing the
arrest of Jones, adds: 'This gentleman has been many
months on a tour through the provinces of Leinster and
Munster, making speculations on the state of the country
through which he passed.' He remained eight months in
Cork, and it is a question whether, during that prolonged stay,
he may not have sought to foment revolution. All memoirs of
Emmet have hitherto been silent as regards the complicity
of Cork in his designs. Kildare is the county of which
mention is chiefly made. The following from the 'Courier'
(London) of August 5, 1803, furnishes a glimpse into the then
state of Cork:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Dublin mail arrived this evening, and brought us letters and
papers of Monday last.... Though there has been no rising in
Cork, yet very unfavourable symptoms of disaffection have appeared
there, and to the south of that city we are sorry to hear that the
malignancy of the former rebellion is by no means extinguished.</p></div>

<p>The same journal, of August 16, 1803, contains a letter
'written by a gentleman of distinction in the county of Cork,'
possibly Mr. Orpen himself, who commanded a corps of
Yeomanry. The writer, after stating that he had spread
yeomen in all directions to prevent the embarkation of persons
charged with treason, goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Todd Jones has been at Dr. Callanan's, Clonakilty, the last eight
months: H.,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> by order of Government, arrested him for high
treason, as also the Doctor and his son.... These measures
have been attended with alarm; but I think we are at present quite
safe; and a strong fleet at Beerhaven relieves me from all apprehension
of an enemy.</p>

<p>The entire of the Yeomanry of this kingdom is now on the
permanent establishment. Our corps is strong, and without vanity
a good one. I have applied for an addition of infantry: with this
augmentation, I shall feel very little apprehension for any attack
made upon us without the aid of foreign force.</p></div>

<p>It appears from this letter, dated August, 1803, that Jones
had been then eight months at Clonakilty in the county Cork:
therefore his arrival would have been in December 1802&mdash;the
very date of the payment of 500<em>l.</em> to Magan by direction of
Mr. Orpen, high sheriff for the county. Meanwhile the
locality in which Jones pitched his camp became, from some
cause, decidedly heated. A letter in the London 'Courier,'
dated 'Cork, August 21,' after recording the arrest of Todd
Jones, Donovan, and Dr. Callanan, states, 'The peasantry in
the neighbourhood of Ross, near Clonakilty, go armed to their
chapels, and mount a regular guard over their arms while
they perform their devotions.'</p>

<p>We have seen that Magan&mdash;traditionally described as an
unsociable person, possessing few friends&mdash;maintained most
intimate relations with James Dickson of Kilmainham, in
whose house Jones was also a constant guest. About the
same time as the arrest of Jones in Cork, the 'Courier' of
August 30, 1803, announces in its Dublin news: 'Yesterday
Mr. James Dickson, of Kilmainham, was arrested at his house
by Messrs. Atkinson<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and Carleton, chief peace-officers, and
his papers searched. The superintendent magistrate had
him conveyed to the Castle, where he underwent examination,
and was afterwards committed to Kilmainham Gaol.'<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Todd Jones, writing at the time, warmly details the circumstances
of his arrest (the italics are his own):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My person has been assaulted in my bed at daybreak, in the
respectable mansion of a venerable friend, Doctor Callanan, near
Clonakilty, and I have been conveyed, very strongly guarded by
Troops, to an ignominious common Gaol: in reaching which, at
the moderate distance of twenty-two miles, I have been wantonly
exhibited, <em>like an already convicted Felon</em>, for two long summer
days, the first and second of August, in <cite>Orange Triumph</cite>, to the
gaze of a very crowded Bandon rabble; and thence paraded, with
like ostentation, <em>through all the streets of Cork</em>, as if <em>in progress to
Execution</em>.&mdash;My venerable friend and hospitable entertainer, Doctor
Calanan, a Physician of the age of seventy, with his only son, <em>on
my account</em>, have been dragged from the same mansion to Prison,
after a similar triumphant exposure of two days, to gazing multitudes,
in the short distance of twenty-two miles: a Man eminent
for a long professional life, dedicated to the Poor, and to the
Peasants, whose tears kept pace with his progress.</p></div>

<p>He then goes on to request that all concerned in his
detainer, including the Sheriff of Cork, may be summoned to
the Bar of Parliament. An account of his shattered health is
sent to the Secretary of State&mdash;'It is my liberty which I pray
for&mdash;a trial&mdash;liberation&mdash;or death! I have been a close
prisoner for eleven weeks, without even having been shown
my indictment, or been told the names of my accusers.'<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>These complaints were made in October, 1803, but entirely
failed to obtain redress. His petition to the king, dated 1808,
resumes the story: 'Within this prison I continued confined
from 23rd July, 1803, until the latter end of October 1805,
when I was unconditionally discharged by the High Sheriff of
the County of Cork&mdash;untried&mdash;unbailed&mdash;unexamined and unredressed.'<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>When the High Sheriff of Cork liberated Jones it may be
assumed that the same authority was instrumental in his
committal. Formerly, high sheriffs took much more active
part in such proceedings than now. No organised system of
police then existed, and the high sheriffs seem to have been
duly impressed with the responsibility of their position. On
March 18, 1800, we find in the Secret Service Money Book,
100<em>l.</em> handed to Mr. Archer, High Sheriff of Wicklow, for the
detection of treason, and on April 27, 1801, a further sum.
But these exertions were dignified in comparison with the acts
of Sir Judkin Fitzgerald, High Sheriff of Tipperary, who, with
his own hands, flogged the peasantry to extort confession.</p>

<p>Emmet's insurrection burst forth in Dublin on the night
of July 23, 1803; that same morning, and at a distance of
150 miles, Jones is arrested.</p>

<p>The connection of Todd Jones with Irish politics was
apparently of a graver and more subtle sort than might be
inferred from Lady Moira's letter to Curran, or even Plowden's
account of him in his History. Plowden, a Catholic&mdash;the
guest, with Jones and Magan, of James Dickson&mdash;says that
the persecution which Jones underwent at the hands of the
Government was due solely to his powerful advocacy of
Catholic Emancipation and Parliamentary Reform. He defends
Jones with all the warmth of friendship; his 'History
of Ireland' enters most largely into the case, and quotes
various orators who sought to vindicate Jones in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
But the reply of the ex-Secretary of State, Mr. Wickham,
finds no place, contrary to Plowden's usual honesty and fulness
in that work. Wickham, as appears from Hansard, rose
from the bed of sickness to reply to Fox, who had taken up the
case of Jones, and addressed the House sitting. He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For some time after the arrest of Mr. Todd Jones, which the
Irish Government was induced to order upon information&mdash;the particulars
of which he could not with any propriety describe, but
which were satisfactory to their minds as to the measure. Mr.
Jones remained in prison without any particular inquiry having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>been instituted in his case. As soon, however, as the trials which
followed the insurrection of 1803, and which so much occupied
the attention of the Irish Government, had terminated, an
inquiry into the case of Mr. Jones took place.... He had
already stated the impossibility of giving a full explanation to the
House without acting unfairly towards the character of the Petitioner.
After the trial of the rebels, and the fullest investigation of
the charge against Mr. Jones, his case became much more serious
than it appeared at the outset. Willing, however, to act with every
possible mildness, his case was submitted to the Crown lawyers
accompanied by this question, 'whether it would be proper to
liberate Mr. Jones,' and their unanimous opinion was decidedly in
the negative. The Irish Government transmitted the case of Mr.
Jones to his Majesty's Ministers in this country, requiring their
advice; and their answer was, that it would be extremely unadvisable
to allow such a person to be at large in Ireland!<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p></div>

<p>Of how Jones's alleged guilt was hushed up, and why the
vengeance of the Attorney-General preferred to fall on 'ostlers,
bakers, carpenters, and old clothes men,' as he said, an idea
may be perhaps formed from a letter addressed by the Right
Hon. William Saurin to Jones, proposing that he should
secretly, and as if of his own accord, exile himself from
Ireland. This letter was enclosed by Wickham to Jones on
October 11, 1803. Saurin, Jones states, had been his schoolfellow.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Madden professes to supply a list of all persons of
substance connected with Emmet in his attempt; also of
persons who were cognisant of his plans, and were supposed
to be favourably disposed towards them; but Todd Jones
obtains no place,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> and therefore the less excuse is needed for
this effort to embrace a long neglected figure, and one not
uninteresting for 'Auld lang syne.'<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

THOMAS COLLINS. PHILLIPS THE SACERDOTAL SPY</h2>


<p>A recent letter from the ex-Crown and Treasury Solicitor
for Ireland quotes the following from Mr. Lecky's notice of
an unnamed spy, and asks me 'Who is he?'<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> 'He was a
Dublin silk merchant,' writes Lecky, 'and can be identified
by a letter from Cooke to Nepean, May 26, 1794, in the
Record Office, London.'<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>I may now state that his name was Collins. Cooke's
letter mentions that 200<em>l.</em> a year had been settled on the
informer of 1794, and that he was recommended for office
in the West Indies&mdash;his future residence in Ireland, after
Rowan's arrest, being unsafe.</p>

<p>Mr. Joynt's query comes not amiss, for John Keogh, also
a silk merchant, was broadly branded by Walter Cox as an
informer, and the plausible indictment is transcribed by Dr.
Madden and enshrined in his <i lang="la">magnum opus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> The charge
against Keogh, who, by the way, preceded O'Connell as
leader of the Irish Catholics, is, however, baseless.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke does not give the Christian name of this Collins,
but later official records describe it as Thomas. Collins was
the first of the systematic informers. Some sheaves of his
letters are still preserved at Dublin Castle, addressed to 'J. G.,'
and heretofore supposed to imply 'Gregory,' a highly distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>secretary to the Lord Lieutenant. But Gregory's
name was William, and 'J. G.' stands for 'Jack Giffard,' whom
Curran and Grattan, in often-quoted philippics, denounced.
The reports furnished to Giffard were regularly passed on to
Cooke, and two letters<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> from Collins to the latter speak of his
confidant 'Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; d.'</p>

<p>The daily reports extend almost unbroken from 1792 to
1795. All are without a signature, while the official endorsement
usual on such letters is confined, in this case, to
'U. I. M.,' meaning, of course, the rebel brotherhood. On
December 15, 1792, he writes to Cooke: 'Implicitly depend
upon my being totally unknown to mankind in this business,
save and except to you and J. G.'<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>Collins&mdash;at each conclave&mdash;feigned to be an advanced
republican, and was regularly invited to attend. New
members, on being admitted, repeated 'a test.' In an early
letter to Giffard he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is contemplated to abolish the Test, as it is found by experience
that it prevents a number of very warm friends to a Reform
from joining us; but I shall oppose it, as we have no business with
any of your <em>lukewarm fellows</em> who may hesitate at going as great
lengths as ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p></div>

<p>In advance of every meeting a list was sent to Collins of
the new candidates for election. Scores of his secret letters
enclose these lists, and announce the results of the ballot, with
the names of the rejected, and it is curiously illustrative of
the precautions taken to ensure secrecy, and as showing
how little Collins was himself suspected, that men much
superior to him were refused admission. Carefully prepared
reports of the proceedings, with the names of the speakers and
of the number present, exist in endless evidence. In one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>letter he encloses, for the Viceroy's satisfaction, the receipt
given to him for his annual subscription to the Society, signed
by Oliver Bond, but the part which names Collins is first
blotted out, and finally cut clean away.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>In August 1792, Cooke deputed Collins to extend his
secret inquiries to a wider area than the Hall in Back Lane
where the United Irishmen met; and the result is found in
the subjoined letter. Its stealthy style contrasts with the
boldness of later missives.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir&mdash;I have made every possible inquiry and I have reason to
think that there now are Foreign agents here who have frequent
conferences with a noble Viscount and his Brother,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> who is a lawyer;
also with J&mdash;hn K&mdash;gh, Ed&mdash;d B&mdash;re and Richard McC&mdash;m&mdash;k.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
For your Information you have a list of such U&mdash;&mdash; I&mdash;&mdash; men
as I think really dangerous from abilities. As to Inclination, the
whole of the Society are nearly <em>alike</em>.</p>

<p>You may be assured that whatever steps Mr. Tandy has for
some time past taken, or is now pursuing, are by the advice of the
before-mentioned noble Viscount<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and Mr. Gr-tt-n; and also, that
let the pretentions (<em>for the present</em>) of the R-m-n Ca&mdash;&mdash; be
ever so moderate, the real design of their <em>leaders</em> is to effect a
separation between this country and Gr&mdash;t B&mdash;t&mdash;n.</p>

<p class="right">I remain, &amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Collins had the same liking for dramatic mystery as Turner;
many of the letters to 'G.' ask him to call at night to hear
things that could not be put on paper, to tap at a certain
door in a dark passage, and 'no one would be the wiser.' In
the graphic sketch he daily furnished, special attention is paid
to the chief 'sitter,' Hamilton Rowan, who presided as chairman
until his arrest; while Tone, Tandy, Emmet, Drennan, Bond,
Lewins, the Sheares, and B. B. Harvey (the last three
afterwards hanged) stand forth in bold outline from a crowd
of minor faces grouped in the background. Sometimes they
all dined together. 'When Paine's health was given his
picture was introduced and received a general embrace.
Several French songs were sung by Mr. Sheares, with proper
explanations for those ignorant of the language.'<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Glimpses
of further feasts are caught, revealing the same familiar faces:
men who had not yet begun to realise the gruesome fact
that the handwriting was on the wall.</p>

<p>John Keogh is not often mentioned as present; and never
after 1793. In October '92 Collins furnishes an abstract of a
spirited speech delivered by Keogh. This led to queries,
and in reply Collins tells Cooke: 'The leaders are Hamilton
Rowan, Tandy, Jackson, Bond, Dowling, McCormick, Warren,
and some others. But Keogh and Drennan are the <em>grand
movers</em>;'<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and on the following day he writes: 'Keogh is the
principal performer behind the scenes&mdash;as the fellow's art is
such he does not appear amongst us, but has a set of fellows
to constantly attend and broach his sentiments.'<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Keogh, a
man of rare sagacity&mdash;whose life has yet to be written&mdash;took
the course described in consequence of having recognised in
his audience a person whom he did not fully trust. Turning
to Richard McCormick, in the hearing of 'Billy Murphy,' the
subsequent millionaire, he said, 'Dick, men's lives are not
safe here,' and glided quietly away. John Keogh is the only
man of mark who passed unscathed through the crisis of '98;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>and Cox, mistakenly believing that this immunity was due to
treachery towards his colleagues, sought to brand him as a
spy.</p>

<p>In 1793, John Keogh, Sir Charles Ffrench and several other
Catholic delegates,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> waited on George III. at St. James's and
presented a petition craving relief from the disabilities by
which their order was oppressed. The loss of America had
preached the wisdom of concession; and the tempest of the
French Revolution roared within measurable distance. While
Pitt and Dundas were not indisposed to grant a full emancipation
to the Irish Catholics, they were constantly opposed in
this policy by Dublin Castle. The often sensational reports
of Collins seem to have had due effect. A long letter to
Cooke regarding the Catholics begins by saying that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are few individuals better acquainted with the views and dispositions
of those people than I am. If they are gratified the day
is not far off when High Mass with all its mummery will be performed
in Christ Church<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>&mdash;the auditors to be a popish Lord Lieutenant,
a popish Chancellor, &amp;c. &amp;c., unless the use of the former
be preceded by an entire separation from Honest John Bull, which
is the grand object of the disaffected of every description in this
country.</p>

<p>Where Government has <em>resisted</em>, the good effects have been
found; when it has <em>relaxed</em>, demands have increased.... To
come to the point: give the Papists all they <em>want</em> or <em>nothing</em>. Without
the former the sword must be drawn at one period or another;
and the query is, whether it's not better to try the <em>event</em> when they
are <em>unprepared</em>, than to continue going on to give the <em>adder</em> time
to strengthen with the heat of <em>summer</em>: not that I think there is
the smallest danger of any <em>war</em> but <em>wordy</em> ones from them&mdash;unless
time and the interference of their <em>Gallic Friends</em> may embolden
them to acts of desperation. [He then proceeds to advise the embodiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>of military corps in Dublin, well officered. The pay to be
such as to induce respectable Protestant tradesmen and others to
enlist.]</p>

<p>Suppose the whole to be mounted and appointed as dragoons,
this small corps will be found of as much use as any Regiment of
Cavalry in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>If a <em>friend</em> of yours<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> should be thought of, I think there would be
an end to all <em>illegal meetings</em>,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> associations and combinations, and I
will answer for his compleating and arraying the number in 10 Days.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p></div>

<p>A small measure of Catholic Relief was at length offered
by Pitt. Collins, a month later, courageously writes: 'If
you think it prudent to have me examined by the Secret
Committee, I may give some useful information previous to
the Catholick Bill going to the Upper House.'<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that, from the regularity and general
accuracy of the spy's reports, Giffard in his conversations
more than once revealed a knowledge that fluttered the Inner
Circle. On February 15, 1794, Collins reports, in the <em>pr√©cis</em>
of proceedings that had taken place that night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A notice by Mr. John Sheares that he will on Friday next propose
a new Ballot of the whole of the Society, or else the total dissolution
thereof, in order, as he says, to get rid of some suspected Members,
who, he says, are in the habit of betraying the Secrets of the Society
to Government. At the time he gave this notice there were not more
than fifteen members present and the proposition seemed to meet
their approbation. The fact is they are all cursedly frightened by
the examples made of some of their friends. Fear only can keep
them in order; gentleness will only encourage their audacity.</p></div>

<p>Three months elapsed: they met and deliberated; the
reports went regularly to Dublin Castle; arrests were made;
the Society wondered; but Collins, though a loaded mine lay
beneath his feet, stood his ground. On Saturday, May 10,
1794, he announces:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Surgeon Wright proposed appointing a commission of inquiry
to inspect into the character and conduct of not only the members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>of the Society, but of all other persons in this city who profess
patriotism, as he had reason to suspect that Mr. Pitt's system of
having spies in all company and in all Societies, had made its way
into this country.</p></div>

<p>Collins, no coward like Turner, maintained his character
as one of the most regular attendants at the meetings,
played his part, opposed some minor propositions,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and
continued his carefully framed reports.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> These reports
perturbed Dublin Castle quite as much as the United
Irishmen had been scared by the leakage of their plans.
On April 28, 1794, Marcus Beresford writes to his father, who
had long been regarded as the virtual governor of Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Government are determined to hang Rowan if possible; but
they have not yet shown any suspicion of any person here being
concerned in the plot, in order to lull them into security. No
person knows as much as I now tell you except Lord Westmoreland,
the Attorney-General, and Sackville Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p></div>

<p>Judging from Cooke's letter to Nepean, Collins' chief enterprise
was in bringing Hamilton Rowan within the meshes
of the law. In 1792, as we learn from his Autobiography,
Rowan was arrested on a charge of distributing a seditious
paper. Informations were filed against Rowan, difficulties
supervened, and he was not brought to trial until January
1794. Rowan offered proof that two of his jurors had
declared 'Ireland would never be quiet until Rowan and
Napper Tandy were hanged.'<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The challenge, however, was
not allowed. Curran acted as his counsel, and delivered a
speech reminding one of Cicero's defence of Milo. Rowan
was found guilty, fined, and committed to Newgate, but, by
bribing his jailer, escaped; and, after various romantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>adventures, reached France in a boat manned by two fishermen
of Howth.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>A proclamation offering 1,000<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> reward for his capture was
read by the men, but they told him not to fear. This remarkable
escape took place on May 4, 1794. Cooke's letter, saying
that Collins' further residence in Ireland would be unsafe, is
dated May 26 following. An amusing proof of the general
distrust which then prevailed is shown in the fact, recorded
by Rowan, that on reaching France he was arrested as a
British spy, sent under a strong guard to Brest, and lodged
with galley-slaves.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Judging from Beresford's letter, written
two days before the escape, however, it cannot be said that
he got out of the frying-pan into the fire, as Rowan seems
to have thought.</p>

<p>Some few letters from Mr. Douglas, who filled a Government
post in London, are intermingled with the Collins
MSS. The Right Hon. John Beresford, in a letter dated
May 13, 1794, writes: 'Douglas called upon me this day;
we had a great deal of conversation about Rowan. He told
me that, as Rowan had escaped, Tone was the next guilty
person, and ought to be hanged.' This, however, it was not
so easy to do. Neither Turner nor Collins would prosecute
openly. Meanwhile some friends of Tone entered into negotiations
with Government, and he was at last allowed to
expatriate himself beyond the seas.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Collins<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> did not get the post for which he was recommended
until the year 1800. It was Dominica, one of the
West Indian Islands, as we learn from the 'S. S. Money Book.'
The first entry of his name is on November 23, 1797: 'Mr.
Collins.&mdash;Sent to him, in London, 108<em>l.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Here he remains
for two years&mdash;no doubt one of the gentlemen 'recommended
by Mr. Cooke,' and mentioned in the 'Castlereagh Correspondence'
as qualified to 'set' the movements of Lord Cloncurry
in London.</p>

<p>In more than one of the secret letters sent by Collins to
Cooke, he offers his services for fields in other countries, where
he thinks he could be even more useful than at home. A
large sheaf of papers regarding troubles in the West Indies
is preserved at Dublin Castle. Dominica&mdash;the site of his
first appointment&mdash;had been captured by the British in 1756,
but in 1771 the French, after a hard fight, once more became
its masters. In 1783 the island was again restored to the
English, but its executive felt far from secure. Intrigue was
at work; French emissaries were not few; and the presence
of Collins, a practised spy, came not amiss. The French,
however, again effected a landing in 1805; Roseau, the chief
town, was obliged to capitulate, and pay the enemy 12,000<em>l.</em>
to quit. In 1890, after the cession of Heligoland to Germany,
there was talk of surrendering Dominica to France.</p>

<p>What was Collins' later history I have been unable to discover.
'Sylvanus Urban' tells of a Thomas Collins who was
hanged; but this is a mere coincidence of name. It is within
the possibilities that our spy may have posed as Governor
Collins, and even received at his levees Hamilton Rowan, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>during the travels by which his exile was beguiled, would pay
his devoirs, as he says, to the British resident.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>An informer of a novel type was a priest named Phillips.
Describing the events of the year 1795, Mr. Froude writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lord Carhampton went down and took command in Connaught.
Informers offered their services, provided their presence was not
required in the witness-box. A Priest named Phillips 'caused
himself to be made a Defender with a view of giving information.'<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
Others came whose names the Viceroy dared not place on paper.
With the help of these men, Carhampton was able to arrest many
of the Connaught Leaders;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> and legal trials being from the nature
of the case impossible, he trusted to Parliament for an Act of
Indemnity, and sent them by scores to serve in the Fleet. Thus,
amidst the shrieks of Patriots and threats of prosecution, he succeeded
in restoring some outward show of order.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p></div>

<p>Among Mr. Froude's startling passages, none created in
Ireland a more painful sensation than this. That an Irish
priest&mdash;the <em>Soggarth Aroon</em><a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> of the people&mdash;should be selling the
lives of his friends, flock, and penitents, was indeed a novel incident.
Interest in the episode has quite recently been revived
by Mr. Lecky, who describes Father Phillips as having given
the Government some really valuable assistance in detecting
Rebel Leaders.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> For all we know to the contrary, this
Ecclesiastic might have gone on to the end undiscovered,
posing and pontificating as a solemn Hierarch. But, in
point of fact, Phillips, though in orders, had been degraded
and suspended by his Ordinary. Dr. Madden, long before the
publication of Froude or Lecky, casually notices Phillips<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> as an
'excommunicated priest from French Park, co. Roscommon.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>His end was involved in some mystery which it may be
well to penetrate. McSkimmins' 'History of Carrickfeargus'
records, under date January 5, 1796: 'The body of a stranger,
said to have been an informer, of the surname of Phillips, was
found in a dam, near the paper mills, Belfast.' How he came
there we learn from James Hope, a Protestant rebel of Ulster.
After the excommunicated priest, Phillips, had betrayed a
number of the Defenders in Connaught, he proceeded to Belfast,
only to find, however, that his character had cast its shadow
before him. A party of Defenders seized Phillips, tried him
on the spot, and sentenced him to death. 'They gave him
time to pray,' adds Hope, 'then put leaden weights into his
pockets, and drowned him.'</p>

<p>Punishment of informers by death was not of the frequency
that McSkimmin supposed and Turner feared. Hope,
who is always truthful, adds, that at a meeting of the
Craigarogan Branch, 'they came to a resolution: "That
any man who recommended or practised assassination of any
person whomsoever, or however hostile to the Society, should
be expelled."'</p>

<p>There is another informer whose name Mr. Froude undertakes
to disclose. In April 1797 Camden sends Portland
'A statement which had been secretly made to him by a
member of the Military Committee of the United Irishmen,'&mdash;and
we learn that the informer in this instance was a miniature
painter named Neville. Due inquiry has failed to find
any man named Neville in the Society of United Irishmen,
though a respectable wine merchant, Brent Neville, appears
as the uncle of Henry Sheares's wife; 'Neville' has been reprinted
in every succeeding edition of Mr. Froude's book. But
it is now quite certain that Neville is a misprint for Newell.
The 'Life and Confessions of Newell (a Spy),' written by himself,
and undoubtedly genuine, was published in London in
1798; and in it (pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>-15) he describes his calling as that of
a miniature painter.</p>

a peerage dating from October 1550. At a meeting of the Society of
United Irishmen in February 1793, Butler in the chair, and Bond acting as
secretary, a declaration was proposed and adopted, pronouncing as illegal
certain proceedings of the Secret Committee of the Irish House of Lords, in
compelling witnesses to answer on oath questions compromising themselves,
and directed to the discovery of evidence mainly in support of prosecutions
already commenced. For this act, Butler and Bond were sentenced by the
Lord Chancellor to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of 500<em>l.</em> to
the King. (See Madden, ii. 244.) Simon Butler was fortunate in not living to
witness the sad scenes of '98.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

LEONARD MCNALLY</h2>


<p>Thirty years ago I published in 'Notes and Queries'<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> an
<em>expos√©</em> of McNally, so far as it could then be done on circumstantial
evidence. His secret letters to the Irish Government
were not accessible when I first touched the subject, but these
have become very familiar to me of late, and it will be seen
that all I sought to show is proved by the revelation of
McNally's own testimony. Before I come to these letters,
some of the remarks with which I had long previously prefaced
my doubts may perhaps be allowed to stand.</p>

<p>It is an object with Mr. Froude to show&mdash;and evidently as
pointing a moral&mdash;that men who posed as the greatest patriots
were secretly betraying the plans of their colleagues. But
although Mr. Froude mentions McNally more than once, it
does not appear that he was an informer. When describing
the arrest and death of the Rev. Wm. Jackson in 1794, he
mentions McNally as 'a popular barrister,' and further on
his name is given with that of Curran, Ponsonby, Emmet,
and Guinness, as constituting 'the legal strength of Irish
Liberalism.' This remark is made in connection with an
episode told with such dramatic effect by Mr. Froude that it
remains merely for a minor pen to unmask 'the popular
barrister.'</p>

<p>Charles Phillips, although he had made the lives of
famous Irish barristers his study, as shown in 'Curran and
his Contemporaries,' refused to believe any tale to the prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of McNally. In the last edition of his popular book
Phillips declares that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The thing is incredible! If I was called upon to point out, next
to Curran, the man most obnoxious to the Government&mdash;who most
hated them, and was most hated by them&mdash;it would have been
Leonard MacNally&mdash;that MacNally, who, amidst the military
audience, stood by Curran's side while he denounced oppression,
defied power, and dared every danger!<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p></div>

<p>In this impression he was supported by W. H. Curran,
afterwards judge&mdash;a man who, unlike his illustrious father,
was of the hardest and coldest nature. He travelled out of
his path, in writing that father's life, to pronounce a panegyric
which is quite a curiosity to exhume:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among many endearing traits in this gentleman's private character,
his devoted attachment to Mr. Curran's person and fame
and, since his death, to the interests of his memory, has been conspicuous.
The writer of this cannot advert to the ardour and tenderness
with which he cherishes the latter, without emotion of the
most lively and respectful gratitude. To Mr. McNally he has to
express many obligations for the zeal with which he has assisted in
procuring and supplying materials for the present work. The introduction
of these private feelings is not entirely out of place&mdash;it
can never be out of place to record an example of steadfastness in
friendship. For three and forty years Mr. McNally was the friend of
the subject of these pages; and during that long period he performed
the duties of the relation with the most uncompromising and romantic
fidelity. To state this is a debt of justice to the dead. The survivor
has an ampler reward than any passing tribute of this sort can
confer, in the recollection that during their long intercourse not
even an unkind look ever passed between them.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p></div>

<p>These remarks were elicited by a scene which occurred
in Finney's trial<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> in '98. John Philpot Curran, embracing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>McNally, said, 'My old and excellent friend, I have long
known and respected the honesty of your heart, but never
until this occasion was I acquainted with the extent of your
abilities. I am not in the habit of paying compliments where
they are undeserved.' Tears fell from Mr. Curran as he
hung over his friend.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Emotion spread to the Bench, and
Judge Chamberlain, and Baron Smith warmly complimented
McNally. Poor Curran! He</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">loved to recall the past moments so dear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the sweet pledge of faith was confidingly given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the lip spoke in voice of affection sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the vow was exchanged and recorded in Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In 1817, when Curran died in England, Burton&mdash;afterwards
judge&mdash;singled out McNally, as the attached friend of the
illustrious dead, to tell him the sad news.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>It does not surprise one that Phillips should have expressed
the scepticism he puts on record. No man was more deeply
versed in Bar traditions. He loved to question its oldest
members about their contemporaries; and amongst all their
ana he never heard, as regards McNally, a dark doubt
started. 'Dr. Madden in his "Life of Robert Emmet,"'
writes Phillips, 'broadly states the fact [that he was in Government
pay], but does not give, as he usually does, his grounds
for so stating it.'<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Madden, replying to Phillips, said, 'I
acknowledge I am ignorant of the time when the pension of
300<em>l.</em> was conferred.'</p>

<p>We now know not only the date, but the nature of the
service by which the pension was earned.</p>

<p>Under-Secretary Cooke, in the year 1800, drew up for
Castlereagh's information a confidential memorandum respecting
'Secret Service Pensions' for those who had given
important assistance during the Rebellion. 'Mac,' for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>pension of 300<em>l.</em> a year, is the first name recommended.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> On
the following page, Mr. Cooke&mdash;obliged to be explicit&mdash;writes
the name <em>Leonard MacAnally</em> in full, with the amount 300<em>l.</em>
as his annual wages.</p>

<p>Major Sirr was chief of the police system in Dublin. His
papers contain no letters from McNally; but Thomas O'Hara,
writing to Sirr on November 11, 1800, proffers his services as
a spy, and requests Sirr to address his answer to 'Leonard
McNally, Esq., 20 Harcourt Street, Dublin.'<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> McNally, irrespective
of the knowledge he possessed as counsel for the
rebels, was himself a 'United Irishman.' An organ of that
body, the 'Northern Star,' on March 3, 1797, proudly describes
him as such in connection with the fact that, some
days previously, he challenged and fought Sir Jonah Barrington
for having used disparaging language towards the United
Irishmen. In this combat he lost his thumb. The two
Sheareses and Bagenal Harvey&mdash;all hanged the following year&mdash;escorted
McNally to the ground.</p>

<p>A number of receipts for quarterly payments of Secret
Service money were stolen from Dublin Castle during the
thirties, and came to the hammer at a literary sale-room.
Among them is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Received from William Taylor, Esqr., Seventy-five pounds, due
the 25th June last.</p>

<p class="right">J. W.</p>

<p>Endorsed (by Mr. Taylor)&mdash;5th July, 1816, 75<em>l.</em> L. M‚ÄòN.</p>

<p class="right">S. A.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p></div>

<p>McNally seems to have been the only recipient who was
permitted to use false initials. The handwriting in the above
is identical with some acknowledged autograph lines of Leonard
McNally; but 'trifles light as air' at first encouraged my
suspicions. For instance: there appears in the 'Cornwallis
Papers,' some five hundred pages away from the part which
mentions him, a letter signed 'J. W.'<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The able editor, Mr.
Ross, cannot guess the writer; but the information given deals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>with matters arising out of legal proceedings, and thereby
points to a barrister as the spy.</p>

<p>In the same letter,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> 'J. W.' states that a man named Bird
is determined to 'let the cat out of the bag.' Here it
may be observed in passing, that a pamphlet of the day is
entitled 'The Cat let out of the Bag,' and, though published
anonymously, the copy now before me displays his well
known autograph, 'By Leonard McNally, Barrister-at-law.'<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>John Pollock was Clerk of the Crown for the Leinster
Circuit in 1798. The Book of Secret Service Money<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> records
frequent payments, through his hands, to 'J. W.' These
entries appear from February 16, 1799, to June 16, 1801,
when the words 'repaid from pension' are added. McNally,
it will be remembered, received his pension the previous
year. Cooke, in a confidential memorandum for Castlereagh,
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pollock's services ought to be thought of. He managed Mac&mdash;&mdash;,
and MacGuicken,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and did much. He received the place of Clerk
of the Crown and Peace, and he has the fairest right to indemnification.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus we see how weak was the attempt made by McNally's
friends to explain away his secret pension. It was plausibly
alleged that McNally, having been refused a silk gown in
1808, the pension was then conferred to compensate for
his disappointment. So popular was this barrister, that the
refusal of the Crown to give him silk was voted a grievance.
Indeed, so far as outward appearance went, he uniformly took
the popular side on all questions. The Bar meeting, to
denounce the proposed Legislative Union, held on December
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>9, 1798, includes, among the patriotic orators, Leonard
McNally.</p>

<p>Some of the reasons given by Phillips for refusing to
doubt McNally's patriotism were, that he declined to join the
lawyers' corps of yeomanry in 1798, and that his was the last
hand Curran grasped when leaving Ireland! These waifs and
strays only prove how well McNally played his part. As a
successful dramatic author, and one who had been himself
upon the stage, theatrical effect was at all times easy to
him.</p>

<p>It is now time to appeal to direct evidence, not until
recently accessible. Mr. Lecky, in examining the archives of
the Home Office, has found record of McNally's fall, and the
virtuous historian describes it as a 'peculiarly shocking one.'<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
It will be remembered that the Rev. Wm. Jackson, a parson,
came to Ireland in 1794 on a secret mission from France.
He was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. McNally
now found, it is said, that if he did not become an informer
the halter would soon encircle a neck previously dignified by
forensic bands.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jackson, shortly before his death [Mr. Lecky goes on to say],
found an opportunity of writing four short letters, recommending
his wife and child, and a child who was still unborn, to two or
three friends, and to the care of the French nation, and he also
drew up a will leaving all he possessed to his wife, and entrusting
McNally with the protection of her interests. He wrote at the
bottom of it, 'Signed and sealed in presence of my dearest friend,
whose heart and principles ought to recommend him as a worthy
citizen&mdash;Leonard McNally.' These precious documents he entrusted,
when dying, to his friend, and about three weeks after the death of
Jackson, McNally placed them in the hands of the Irish Government.</p>

<p>A few days later, Camden sent a copy of them to England, with
a 'most secret and confidential letter.' 'The paper which accompanies
this,' he said, 'was delivered to Counsellor McNally, from
whom Government received it. There is so much evidence against
this person, that he is&mdash;I am informed&mdash;completely in the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Government. Your Grace will observe that the care of Mrs. Jackson
is recommended by her husband to the National Convention,
and that Mr. McNally is desired to assist her by every means in his
power to procure her assistance from them. It has occurred to me
that an excuse might be made for Mr. McNally's being allowed to
enter France for the purpose of attending to this woman's fortunes,
that he should go through London, and in case your Grace should
wish to employ him, I would inform you when and where he will
be found.'</p>

<p>Portland replied that he was perfectly ready to make use of the
services of McNally in France, if Camden thought that he might be
safely trusted, but he suggested that this was very doubtful. The
control which Government possessed over him depended entirely
upon the conclusive evidence of treason they had against him.
Would that control continue in a foreign country? Camden, on
reflection, agreed that it would not be safe to try the experiment.
McNally, however, he was convinced, would be very useful at
home.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p></div>

<p>Jackson, finding no chance of acquittal, took poison and died,
just as Lord Clonmell was about to sentence him to be hanged.
Shortly before his death in the dock, seeing McNally pass, he
grasped his hand and is said to have whispered, 'We have deceived
the Senate!' This was true of McNally, but Jackson
did not suspect him; nor did Curran, or the many other
shrewd scribes who have chronicled the touching incident.</p>

<p>Mr. Lecky thinks that McNally's fall dates only from 1794:
my belief is that he had previously evinced some frailty. In
1790, when counsel for Lord Sherborne, Beresford Burston
accused him of 'doing dirty work,'<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> and McNally thereupon
challenged Burston. Dr. Madden says that, in 1792, at the time
of Napper Tandy's action against the Viceroy, some of Tandy's
legal advisers were suspected of having disclosed their
ingenious case to the Crown. McNally was certainly counsel
in this cause. St. John Mason, brother-in-law of Addis
Emmet, broadly charges McNally with perfidy committed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
1792.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Previous to this date Collins the spy calls McNally
'one of us,' in a secret letter to the Government agent, Jack
Gifford.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Who Gifford was is shown by Curran, who complains
to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, that 'Gifford, a note-taker
for your Government, had the daring to come up to me in the
street and shake his stick at me.'<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lecky says that McNally often betrayed to the Crown
the line of defence contemplated by his clients, and other
information which he could only have received in professional
confidence, and the Government archives contain several of
his briefs annotated in his own hand. Mr. Lecky finds that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>he was also able, in a manner not less base, to furnish the Government
with early and most authentic evidence about conspiracies
which were forming in France. James Tandy<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> ... was his intimate
friend; McNally, by his means, saw nearly every letter that
arrived from Napper Tandy, and some of those which came from
Rowan and Reynolds. The substance of these letters was regularly
transmitted to the Government, and they sometimes contained information
of much value. Besides this, as a lawyer in considerable
practice, constantly going on circuit, and acquainted with the leaders
of sedition, McNally had excellent opportunities of knowing the
state of the country, and was able to give very valuable warnings
about the prevailing dispositions.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p></div>

<p>Among the earlier victims to the severe legislation of that
time was Laurence Conner, a poor schoolmaster of Naas,
charged with Defenderism, whose case has been invested with
interest by Sir Jonah Barrington, Dr. Madden, and others. A
moving speech from the dock failed to avert his doom, and
his head, for years after, grinned from a stake at the top of
the gaol. McNally, who had defended him, stated in his
secret report to Pelham that a provision had been offered for
Conner's family if he would make discoveries; but his reply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>was, 'He who feeds the young ravens in the valley will
provide for them!'<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> It is strange that McNally should report
to his employers this chivalrous speech, which places in marked
contrast his own frailty and disgraceful fall. But corrupt as
his heart had now become, he could not help admiring magnanimity
wherever he met it. The man who sought to make
Conner inform was, doubtless, McNally himself, at the instance
of Crown Solicitor Pollock, who, as the 'Cornwallis Papers'
record (iii. 120), 'managed Mac.'</p>

<p>This is the man whose name Earl Russell erased from
Moore's Diary of February 27, 1835, leaving merely the initials
'L. McN.,' because some doubts of his honesty had been
expressed postprandially by Plunket, a man more clear-sighted,
it appears, than Charles Phillips. Succeeding chapters
will show Plunket associated with McNally during the State
trials of '98.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lord Holland amused with my saying how much I used to look
up to this L&mdash;&mdash; McN&mdash;&mdash; [writes Moore], on account of some songs
in a successful opera which he wrote, 'Robin Hood.' 'Charming
Clorinda' was one of the songs I used to envy him being the
author of.</p></div>

<p>'Your profession should have taught you principles of
honour,' McNally writes in the piece which first roused the
muse of Moore. With such fine sentiments it must have
caused him a struggle to betray. All will rejoice that he who
sang</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let Erin remember the days of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere her faithless sons betrayed her&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>escaped the blight of McNally's breath. Moore was the
bosom friend of Emmet, sympathised with the 'cause,' and
wrote for the organ of the United Irishmen. Shortly after
'98, however, he entered at the Middle Temple, London, and
saw McNally no more. Plunket told Moore that it was in
a duel McNally received the wound in the hip that lamed
him, and on a subsequent occasion, when he was again going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
out to fight, a friend said, 'I'd advise you, Mac, to turn the
other hip to him, and who knows but he may shoot you
straight.'<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>McNally was indeed a brave man. If anyone seemed
to doubt him, he would be called out and probably shot. In
early life he practised at the English Bar. It is recorded in
the 'Cyclop√¶dian Magazine,' for 1808, that during the Gordon
Riots, when the mob had smashed down the Bishop of
Lincoln's coach, had dragged him out, and were beating him
with bludgeons, McNally, at the risk of his life, rescued
Dr. Thurlow, on whose forehead, he heard them say, they
meant to cut the sign of the cross. This prelate, who
somewhat favoured Catholic Relief, was the brother of Lord
Chancellor Thurlow; and the young barrister may have had
an ulterior object in thus exposing himself to danger.
McNally himself evidently supplied the account, of which
but a few details are here borrowed, and we learn that 'the
Bishop required, and received, the address of his protector,
but never after acknowledged the obligation.'<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Some pamphlets
on the Regency struggle, and the 'Claims of Ireland'
vindicated on the principles of the English Whigs, introduced
him to Fox, for whom he acted as counsel at an election for
Westminster. 'By whatever right England possesses Liberty,'
he said, 'by the same right Ireland may claim it!'</p>

<p>McNally as an orator was declamatory, and at times
theatrical. His outward man has been often caricatured, but
John O'Keefe tells us that he had 'a handsome, expressive
countenance, and fine sparkling dark eyes.'<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Sir Jonah
Barrington recognises the same features. Contemporary
memoirs of him supply a long list of his dramas, farces,
comic operas, touching lyrics, prologues and masques, all
produced at Covent Garden. But when in England he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>a genuine, thoroughgoing Irishman very unlike the sham
which he afterwards became; and why he resigned a dramatic
for a forensic career is curiously shown by 'Sylvanus Urban.'
The opening of Covent Garden Theatre, on September 23, 1782,
was commemorated by a prelude from McNally's pen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The author, with a partiality to his own countrymen which we
know not how to censure, has drawn the character of an Irishman
as one possessed of qualities which he had rather imprudently denied
to the other persons of the drama&mdash;English, Scotch, Welsh, and
French. This circumstance gave offence, and before the conclusion
of the piece the clamour became too great for anything to be heard.
It was, therefore, laid aside.</p></div>

<p>No name seems to have been more popular with the pit
and galleries, and the admiration of his countrymen for him
showed itself in odd ways. Kemble somewhere describes an
Irishman at Drury Lane indignantly claiming one of Shakespeare's
plays for McNally: and when a spectator, duly
challenged, replied that he did not want to dispute the point
with him, his tormentor said, still trying to foster a quarrel,
'but perhaps you don't believe me?' Again the man received
a polite assurance which seemed quite satisfactory; but five
minutes later 'Pat,' observing Kemble whispering to a companion,
came over in an attitude still more menacing&mdash;'Maybe
your friend doesn't believe that the play is written by Leonard
McNally?' and to avoid a scene both were glad to decamp.
Those were the days when the voice of national predilection
made itself heard and felt in dramatic criticism. Home scored
a success with 'Douglas:' 'and where be your Wully Shakespeare
noo?' was shrieked by some clannish Scots that night.
McNally's friends regretted more than once that he ever left
London. A book called 'Five Hundred Celebrated Authors
of Great Britain now living' was published here in 1788,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> and
it is amusing to find McNally's name included with those of
Burke, Gibbon, Walpole, Crabbe, Burns, Cowper, De Lolme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>and Mackenzie, who at the close of a century were helping
to educate the minds which were to adorn its successor.</p>

<p>One day Lord Loughborough, finding McNally ill prepared
in a case which came before the Court, advised him to abandon
the Muses and study Blackstone; but the <i lang="la">caco√´thes scribendi</i>
burned too strongly within him to relinquish more cultured
pursuits. His 'Sentimental Excursions to Windsor' appeared,
and on rejoining the Irish Bar he produced 'The Irish Justice
of the Peace,' for which 2,500<em>l.</em> was paid by Hugh Fitzpatrick,
the Catholic publisher; 'but it contained so much
bad law,' writes Charles Phillips, 'that it proved a treasure not
to the J. P's., but to the country attorneys.' Sadly soon the
former had practical experience of a writ; and Michael Staunton
told me, that if McNally's law points often served culprits,
they hanged as many more.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> 'In Dublin,' records a contemporary
scribe,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> 'he has now very considerable law business.'</p>

<p>'He had a shrill, full, good bar voice,' writes Barrington,
in bestowing other praise. Sir Jonah occupied the judgment
seat, and was famous for his power of discerning character;
but, although he impugns the good name of many men, he
does not distrust McNally. According to Barrington, 'Mac'
was 'good-natured, hospitable, and talented.'<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> It is to be
feared that hospitality with the popular barrister was but
a means to an end. 'Will you walk into my parlour?' said
the spider to the fly. McNally, in some of his letters to the
Government when requesting money, urges as an extra reason
the necessity of entertaining friends in order to get at new
information.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Without money [he writes] it is impossible to do what is expected.
Those Spartans wish to live like Athenians in matters of
eating and drinking. They live so among each other, and without
ability to entertain I cannot live with them, and without living
with them I cannot learn from them.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p></div>

<p>McNally knew human nature quite as well as Bishop South,
who says of the bacchanal that his 'heart floats upon his lips,
and his inmost thoughts proclaim and write themselves upon
his forehead;' and he adds that, just 'as a liar ought to have
a good memory, so a person of guilt ought to be also a person
of great sobriety.'<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> McNally's dinner in honour of unfortunate
'Parson Jackson' and of the man who shadowed him to
the grave, suggests that it was not the only occasion when
death sat at the table.</p>

<p>In midsummer 1798 the clangour of battle filled the air.
'Fear prevails, and all jovial intercourse has ceased, so far as
my experience goes,'<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> he writes; but when hostilities ceased,
amenities were renewed.</p>

<p>After he had ceased to produce 'masques' at Covent
Garden, and entered on his new career of a barrister and a
spy, one great effort of his energetic life was to divert suspicion
and puzzle posterity. He saw the wisdom of the proverb,
'Show me your company,' and thus he had a double object
to gain by cultivating touch with patriotic men. In 1790 he
was admitted a Freeman for&mdash;as the address to him said&mdash;his
services to his country. In 1802 he published 'The Rules of
Evidence, or Pleas of the Crown.' It is dedicated to John Philpot
Curran, 'from an affectionate attachment,' writes McNally,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>and from a proud wish to make known to posterity that a reciprocal
and an uninterrupted amity subsisted between the Author and the
man whose transcendent genius and philosophic mind soar above
all competition&mdash;whose honest and intrepid heart was never influenced
in the Senate, nor intimidated at the Bar, from exerting, with
zeal, independence, and spirit, his love to his country and his duty
to his client.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The 'authorised' memoir of McNally in the 'Cyclop√¶dian
Magazine' quotes the above, adding, 'The relatives of Mr.
Curran may extract from this dedication an epitaph worthy of
his memory.' The whole object of the memoir, one evidently
inspired by McNally himself, is to foster a feeling of respect
for and confidence in his own pretensions. No wonder that,
in the eyes of Young Ireland one hundred years ago, a halo
encircled McNally's head. Some of the spirited efforts which
roused the Muse of Moore and Drennan are found in the organ
of the United Irishmen. The 'Northern Star' of November
10, 1792, contains rebellious verses signed L. M. N.</p>

<p>Mr. Lecky has not examined McNally's secret reports
after the year 1800, and his impression is that he 'did not
wish to implicate "persons."'<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> It would appear, however, on
Mr. Lecky's own showing, that McNally was not squeamish&mdash;even
during the reign of terror&mdash;in pointing to men by name.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In September and October 1797 he told them [writes Mr. Lecky]
that Bond was the treasurer of the conspiracy; that the chief management
was now transferred from Belfast to Dublin and confined
to a very few; that Keogh, McCormick, Lord Edward Fitzgerald,
Arthur O'Connor, Sweetman, Dixon, Chambers, Emmet, Bond, and
Jackson were in the secret.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p></div>

<p>On February 5, 1797, McNally warns the Government
that O'Coigly (hanged the following year) was in Ireland on
a political mission, and reports the pith of his conversation.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
'O'Connor, Macnevin and Lord Edward Fitzgerald,' he
whispers, 'are the advocates of assassination,'<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> which, indeed,
there is great reason to doubt.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> On November 19 Grattan is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>put in jeopardy.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Next month 'a most circumstantial and
alarming story,' writes Lecky, had come from McNally. 'It
was, that Lord Edward received, some days since, orders
from Paris to urge an insurrection here with all speed, in
order to draw troops from England. In consequence of it,
there was a meeting of the head committee, where he and
O'Connor urged immediate measures of vigour;' and thereupon
their plans are laid bare: but how Emmet, Chambers,
etc., opposed. McNally lived in Dominic Street, near the
Dominican Fathers. In letters to Cooke he points to MacMahon
and other of his reverend colleagues; and I learn from
the present custodian of the 'Dominican Records' that Fathers
MacMahon, Bushe, and Mulhall were arrested in '98, but at
last suffered to leave Ireland for America. On May 24, 1798,
J. W. mentions that MacMahon had called on him the previous
day. But so early as June 14, 1797 the falcon eye of
McNally had become fixed on this friar. He and other priests,
he states, meet weekly at Herbert's tavern, Clontarf. 'Reilly,
an officer who served in Germany, is often with them. Individually,
no doubt, they are all concerned in the politics of
the day, and they act when together with a caution certainly
suspicious. Vernon, of Clontarf, offered the waiter 100<em>l.</em> to
make discoveries, which he refused.'</p>

<p>'Troy may be up,'<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> McNally reports, meaning that the
Catholic archbishop had been probably enrolled a United
Irishman. Henceforth his Grace's letters were regularly
opened at the Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Minor names are often breathed,
and who can doubt that, with the Habeas Corpus Act suspended,
advanced men stood upon the brink of an abyss? Carhampton,
Commander-in-Chief, sent numbers of untried men
out of the country,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and threatened to do the same with the
Rev. Edward Berwick,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and others. Hundreds were seized
on bare suspicion and expatriated without even knowing their
accusers, or hearing the charge for which they suffered.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The acts of no member of the Directory are more regularly
reported than those of Arthur O'Connor. McNally seems to
have been in his confidence as political ally and legal adviser.
In turning over his letters I met one much more voluminous
than the rest, furnishing a complete list of all the witnesses to
appear at Maidstone for O'Connor's defence, and the facts to
which they were prepared to testify.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> These witnesses included
Erskine, Fox, Grattan, Sheridan, Whitbread, Lords
Moira, Suffolk, Thanet, and Oxford.</p>

<p>Throughout the State Trials men stalked who, as Curran
said, measured their value by the coffins of their victims,
and gloom was relieved by forensic <em>persiflage</em>. The duel
already described left McNally lame, and another limping
barrister one day asked Parsons in 'the Hall' of the Court,
'Did you see McNally go this way?' 'I never saw him go
any other way,' was the reply.</p>

<p>Ned Lysaght had his skit, too:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One leg is short which makes him lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore the legs don't tally;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, my friends, to tell his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis Leonard MacAnally.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>He had been urged to join a Volunteer corps; but Curran
told him that serious trouble might result, for, when ordered
to 'march,' he would certainly 'halt.'<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> When writing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Cooke on the subject of the Lawyers' Corps, J. W., in a secret
letter of June 12, 1798, introduces his real name, no doubt to
puzzle outsiders into whose hands it might fall: 'It would
be well perhaps if some of the judges would institute a Corps
of Invalids. McNally might lead blind Moore to battle.'</p>

<p>Mr. Lecky thinks that McNally after his fall 'retained all
the good nature and native kindness of his disposition.'<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> I
fear that this redeeming virtue cannot be safely assigned to
him. A careful sketch of the man appears in a local publication
of the year 1806; and we learn that among his characteristics
are&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>This, as we now see, was done quite as much in the privacy
of his study as in the forensic arena.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Curran's great speech in Hevey <em>v.</em> Sirr contains a passage
which has often been quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A learned and respected brother barrister had a silver cup;
Major [Sandys] heard that for many years it had borne an inscription
of 'Erin go bragh'&mdash;which meant 'Ireland for ever.' The
Major considered this perseverance for such a length of time a forfeiture
of the delinquent vessel. My poor friend was accordingly
robbed of his cup.</p></div>

<p>This 'learned and respected barrister' was none other than
McNally himself. I have read his secret letter to Cooke on the
subject, endorsed 'June 2, 1798,' and it makes him less a hero
than he would publicly convey. He complains of the seizure
of his cup, notwithstanding that, as he assured his military
visitor, he had already erased the offending inscription. 'Mac,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>in conclusion, says that the cup was value for 22<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em>, 'hardly
earned,' and encloses a separate paper distinctly naming that
sum as his due. Four days later he writes to Cooke: 'Major
Sandys returned a <em>sterling</em> answer to <em>my friend's</em> note,' which
means a full money remittance for the amount claimed.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>Below we have McNally's version of this transaction,
as supplied to Curran's son for historic and popular purposes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A sergeant waited upon him, and delivered a verbal command
from Major Sandys to surrender the cup. Mr. McNally refused,
and commissioned the messenger to carry back such an answer as
so daring a requisition suggested.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The sergeant ... respectfully
remonstrated upon the imprudence of provoking Major Sandys.
The consequences soon appeared: the sergeant returned with a
body of soldiers, who paraded before Mr. McNally's door, and were
under orders to proceed to extremities if the cup was not delivered
up. Upon Mr. MacNally's acquainting Lord Kilwarden with the
outrage, the latter burst into tears and, exclaiming that 'his own
sideboard might be the next object of plunder, if such atrocious
practices were not checked,' lost not an instant in procuring the
restitution of the property. The cup was accordingly sent back
with the inscription erased.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p></div>

<p>Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, was the Chief Justice of the
King's Bench, and his alleged intimacy with McNally is probably
exaggerated. The biographer says that Curran repeatedly
told this episode of '98, and quotes a touching
peroration regarding Kilwarden's alleged interposition: that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>in fact, great was the odour of its memory and precious the
balm of its consolation!</p>

<p>McNally's account of the robbery of his silver cup was part
of his stock-in-trade, and I am sure that for twenty times the
price he would not have been without it.</p>

<p>William Henry Curran knew not very much of his father,
whose biographer he became. John Philpot Curran had excluded
him from his domestic circle, and the letters to his son
which appear in the book were addressed to Richard. Who
can doubt that much detail which lends interest to the ever
popular 'Life, by his Son,' was supplied to the youth by the
practised old scribe Leonard McNally? Curran's gratitude
to him for help afforded is freely expressed. McNally wrote a
style clear as rock water and full of classic strength. Nothing
can be finer than his secret letters to Pelham and Cooke&mdash;three
of which he often despatched in one day. The wonderful
anecdotes which made Curran's Life, by his son, almost a
classic have been quoted over and over, including the dinner
scene at McNally's, when the ill-fated Rev. Mr. Jackson was
entertained. Curran's son tells how the talk had been getting
imprudent, when the butler, beckoning his master to the
door, warned him to be careful; 'for, sir, the strange gentleman
who seems to be asleep is not so, but listening to everything
said: I see his eye glistening through the fingers with
which he is covering his face.'</p>

<p>Cockayne was, of course, a spy of Pitt's; but some of the
sensational anecdotes which McNally told of him, as also of
Reynolds and Armstrong, may have been overcharged to
divert suspicion from himself. These are not the only instances
in which the embellishments of the professional
advocate seem traceable. As regards Jackson's death in the
dock, we are told that he made an effort with his cold and nerveless
hand to squeeze McNally's, muttering a quotation from
Addison's 'Cato'; but the lines and the adjuncts would be
more likely to occur at such a moment to an old playwright
like McNally than to the dying clergyman.</p>

<p>Emmet's revolt took place on July 23, 1803, but was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
quelled. He remained in concealment at Harold's Cross, and
chose that position in order that he might see Sarah Curran,
with her father, pass daily to Dublin. On August 25 he was
arrested by Major Sirr. Popular confidence in McNally had
now reached its height. A special commission for trying the
insurgent leaders began on August 24, 1803. 'Most of the
prisoners chose Mr. McNally as their counsel, and Mr. L.
McNally, junior, as their agent,' records the 'Evening Post'
of the day.</p>

<p>McNally had long had his eye on the gifted young orator
Robert Emmet: 'Emmet, junior, gone on business to France&mdash;probably
to supersede Lewins,'<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> he writes to Cooke three
years previous to the insurrection of 1803. On September 3,
in the latter year, McNally sends one of his secret letters to
Cooke, saying that he is authorised to treat on behalf of a
person privy to the whole conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The remainder of McNally's letters during these troubles of
1803 are yet wanting. No doubt they remain among Wickham's
papers of the period which are still a sealed book.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Among
the sensational incidents of the hour was the outrage of
searching Curran's house, and the capture of Emmet's love-letters
to Sarah Curran&mdash;to whom the youth had been secretly
engaged. Curran himself, we are told, though aware of
Emmet's visits, was ignorant of the attachment. But there
was a seemingly dear old friend, having access to Curran's
domestic circle, whose eagle eye could penetrate still deeper
secrets. In the absence of McNally's private reports of that
month there is, however, no absolute proof against him on
this point.</p>

<p>Mount Jerome,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> the seat of John Keogh, the great Catholic
leader, was also searched, and his papers seized. Dr. Madden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>mentions that, in 1802, Emmet had dined at Keogh's in the
company of John Philpot Curran, when the probability of
success in the event of a second rebellion was debated with
great animation.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Whose was the whisper which betrayed this
information never transpired. But Curran, the great depository
of popular secrets, maintained, as will be shown, no
reserve with McNally. So far back as 1797 McNally writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Grattan and Curran are compleatly in the secret. Everything
that's done or intended is communicated to them.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p></div>

<p>A quantity of information follows, and the letter ends with
these pregnant words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Curran gives a dinner at his house. <em>Will be there.</em></p></div>

<p>This is the man whom William Henry Curran describes as
having been 'from his youth to his latest hour the most
affectionate, unshaken and disinterested friend' of his father.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>Before and after the conviction and death of Robert
Emmet, the initials 'L. M.' peep from the 'Secret Service
Money Book.' On August 25, 1803 (the very day on which
Emmet was captured), we read: 'Mr. Pollock for L. M.,
100<em>l.</em>' Pollock, Clerk of the Crown for Leinster, is the same
man through whom the bribes for 'J. W.' (McNally) are paid.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
The 100<em>l.</em> cannot have been for the actual capture of Emmet,
for I know that in November following a bulk sum was paid
for that service. The <em>douceur</em> to L. M. was in acknowledgment
of useful information.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>McNally appears as counsel for Emmet in the State trial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>on September 19, 1803. Four days previously, namely, on
September 14, 100<em>l.</em> is set down to 'L. M.' On the morning
of Emmet's execution an affecting scene took place between
the rebel chief and McNally, the only friend allowed to see
him. Emmet's mother had just died, but he did not know it,
and desire to see her filled him&mdash;'Then, Robert, you shall
meet her this day,' replied McNally, pointing to Heaven in
his accustomed dramatic style. A long account of the
interview, doubtless supplied by 'Mac' himself with his usual
itch for writing, and evidently designed to promote Lord
Hardwicke's popularity as Viceroy, appears in a Ministerial
journal, the London 'Chronicle,' on September 24, 1803.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Emmet [we are told] observed that, had he not been interrupted
by the Court in his address, he would have spoken as warm an
eulogium on the candour and moderation of the present Government
in this kingdom as his conception or language were
adequate to.</p></div>

<p>After Emmet's arrest Curran was examined by the Privy
Council, when Chancellor Redesdale sought by a tone of intimidation
to extort the truth; but the scowl of contempt he
encountered gave his own nerves the shock he designed for
another's, and made him sink back into his chair, abashed by
the failure of his rash experiment. Curran's son speaks of
the wonderful intrepidity of McNally's language in his addresses
to the Court; but it is easy to be defiant when one
knows he is safe. Contemporary critics record his marvellous
power of penetration in cross-examining witnesses on the
State trials. A shrewd man, deep in the secrets of both sides,
would not find it hard to create this impression.</p>

<p>Lord Cloncurry complains, in his Memoirs, that after his
liberation from gaol in 1801, and for many subsequent years, no
man suffered more from petty worries at the hands of the Irish
Government. McNally was in the coterie of which Cloncurry
formed the central figure, and it cannot be doubted that he
consistently reported his fervid sentiments. The 'Press' was
the Rebel organ, its tone distinguished, as Lord Camden said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
by 'an unheard-of boldness,'<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> and a friendly offer made by
Lawless, afterwards Lord Cloncurry, to McNally is thus
reported. After mentioning when the private committee of
United Irishmen met, McNally<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> announces&mdash;the underlining
his own:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lawless, principal proprietor of the 'Press': <em>he has offered a share
to J. W.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>&mdash;a ¬£50 share</em>.... Nothing save rebellious toasts at
the dinner; <em>McNevin was there</em>. Lawless gave 'Cut the Painter'
[<em>i.e.</em> Separation from England].</p>

<p><em>An accurate and dayly</em> [sic] <em>account will be given</em>. Lawless
sails for London to-morrow night. It is his turn of duty,&mdash;perhaps
to meet some people at the Head. He ought to be watched from
George's Quay every hour till his return.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p></div>

<p>A later letter assures Pelham: 'The fellow-travellers of
Lawless shall be found out if possible.'<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Higgins and Magan knew nothing of Cloncurry's movements,
but between Turner and McNally he had a warm time
of it. Lord Holland compared his long detention in the Tower,
untried and unaccused, to the operation of the <i lang="fr">lettres de cachet</i>
in old France. In 1803, on secret but, he declares, erroneous
information, that Emmet's wounded rebels were concealed
there, 'a large military force' searched Lord Cloncurry's
house in Kildare, and robbed it of a quantity of papers, some
fowling-pieces, armour, and even plate.'<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>No details are forthcoming as regards the intercourse
which subsisted between McNally and Cloncurry throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>the eventful period subsequent to their friendly relations in
'98; but the cordiality of that intercourse may be seen from
a waif or two. The 'Correspondent,' a Dublin journal,
reports on August 27, 1817, a speech of the patriot peer,
Cloncurry, in which the epithet 'dear' is applied to his old
friend McNally. 'There is no gentleman,' he adds, 'for whom
I have a higher respect or esteem, and of whose knowledge,
talent and elocution I am more sensible.'</p>

<p>Sometimes McNally travelled as a spy, probably in disguise,
through remote rural districts. On August 28, 1805, he
announces Tipperary as 'ready to rise.' In September he
goes up the Dublin mountains, 'Emmet's line,' and the result
of his inquiries was that no rising need be apprehended.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> I
do not find that McNally's secret letters exist at Dublin Castle
beyond the year 1805; I must, therefore, seek to trace from
other sources the close of his career. Pecuniary need drew
its toils tighter round him every day, making him, no
doubt, more energetic in his effort to cast them off.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>Readers of the 'Wellington Correspondence' from 1807 to
1809 will be able to identify McNally. The subjugator of
Tippoo Saib, then Chief Secretary at Dublin Castle, found
Catholic Ireland galled by various disabilities. One letter,
dated November 21, 1807, encloses a paper headed 'Information
received this evening from a very intelligent Priest.'<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
This, on being quoted by the reviewers of the Wellington
Papers, excited disgust that a priest should be in secret correspondence
with Dublin Castle; but it is quite clear to me
that the letter came from McNally, and embodies merely the
responses of a gossiping priest to the pumping of a practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>hand&mdash;the same, I may venture to add, to whom McNally,
upon dying, will be found making his own confession.</p>

<p>The Whig Duke of Bedford took office with Fox, Lansdowne,
and Grey in the administration of 'All the Talents,' and
ruled Ireland for one year. Curran became Master of the
Rolls, and McNally thought that he himself, as the leading
popular barrister, had claims for promotion. All the men
who will be remembered as voting with him at the bar meeting
in 1799 had got snug berths. His appeal to Bedford was
referred to Wellesley, whose common sense appears in the
following reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I agree entirely with you respecting the employment of our
informer. Such a measure would do much mischief. It would disgust
the loyal of all descriptions, at the same time that it would
render useless our private communications with him, as no further
trust would be placed in him by the disloyal. I think that it might
be hinted to him that he would lose much of his profit, if, by accepting
the public employment of Government, he were to lose the confidence
of his party, and consequently the means of giving us information.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p></div>

<p>Curiously enough, at the time he is himself most active as
a spy, Mr. T. Mulock, of Dublin, reports him, with Messrs.
Hutton and O'Connell, as persons who 'ought to be watched.'<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
An account of the first meeting for Repeal of the Union, on
September 18, 1810, is preserved in the State Papers; and
McNally spoke on that day 'with great zeal and patriotism,'
as Plowden proudly<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> records. Mr. Mulock had not the knowledge
of character shown by his kinswoman Miss Mulock, the
novelist.</p>

<p>Reference has been already made to the fact that in 1811
the Irish Secretary of State, Wellesley Pole, with the object of
suppressing the Catholic Committee, caused to be arrested,
under the Convention Act, Lord Fingall, Lord Netterville, and
the other Catholic delegates. Able counsel were retained by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>them, and private conferences, attended by Burrowes, Johnson,
Perrin, O'Connell, Burton, O'Driscoll, and McNally, were
held in order to decide on the lines of defence to be taken.
The questions involved were difficult and subtle; and although
the courses decided upon were equally novel, it was observed
with amazement that the Orange Attorney-General, Saurin,
seemed marvellously well prepared for every point, as the
delegates daily fought their ground inch by inch.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>An aggregate meeting of Catholics was held after the arrests
of their delegates. John Mitchel describes the party then in
power as a 'No Popery Administration,' and the appearance
of a Protestant on the platform was hailed as a happy incident.
The following is taken from the 'Correspondent,' a once influential
organ of Dublin Castle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. McNally offered himself to the consideration of the Catholic
body. He was anxious that his name should be coupled to the
glorious cause for which, as Irishmen, they were contending&mdash;a
cause that, from his earliest youth, although a Protestant, he
felt as his own. He insisted that the conduct of the Lord Lieutenant
was illegal&mdash;that he had not the power of arresting an individual
by his own mere authority; that, not having the authority, he could
not, of course, delegate it to a Magistrate.&mdash;[Here he animadverted
upon the conduct of Mr. Hare, the police magistrate, who made the
arrests.] The King himself, he said, possessed not the power which
the Lord Lieutenant assumed in the arrest of Lords Fingal and
Netterville. He instanced the case of Chief Justice Hussey and
Edward IV.&mdash;The King asked the Judge whether his own warrant
would not be deemed sufficient to arrest a subject?&mdash;The Chief
Justice answered in the negative. And the reason was obvious.
<em>The King can do no wrong.</em>&mdash;But the subject could have no legal
redress against such an impeccable magistrate. He referred to the
State trials for an exemplification and authority on this point; and
he showed that a power which could not be exercised by Majesty
itself, could not pass through the opaque body of his Lieutenant&mdash;a
moonshine and intermitting ray.</p></div>

<p>O'Connell followed, and the clear head of that great lawyer
saved the Catholic body from the deeper pitfall in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
bad law of a false adviser would have placed them. In the
course of his speech he declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With regard to what had been said by Mr. McNally he could
not assent. The action of Mr. Hare was merely his own, as a
magistrate, and the Lord Lieutenant had no concern in being responsible
for it; and he [Mr. O'Connell] would not allow in that
assembly anything to be laid to the charge of the Duke of Richmond
for which His Grace was not in every respect accountable.</p></div>

<p>On October 19, 1811, Wellesley Pole writes from Dublin
Castle to the Home Secretary regarding the proceedings of
the Catholic Committee, and enclosing 'a report from,' as he
says, 'one of our spies.' This document, signed 'J. W.' is
still preserved with Pole's letter in the Record Office, London.
About the same time Pole announces to the Home Office that
'Young Mr. Curran, son of the Master of the Rolls, has been
very active in soliciting from the Catholics subscriptions for
Mr. Finnerty, and letters from persons associated in London
for promoting that object have been addressed to the
Catholics here.'<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> These regular reportings of Curran's
domestic circle involve a degree of treachery painful to
contemplate.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>The reports of 'J. W.' did not tend to make Curran a
favourite with 'the powers.' The patriot's son, describing a
prior year, records:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A party of seventeen soldiers, accompanied by their wives, or
their profligate companions, and by many children, and evidently
selected for the purpose of annoyance, were, without any previous
notice, quartered on Mr. Curran's house.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p></div>

<p>The late Mr. Byrne, an old Petty Sessions clerk, informed
me that when walking at this time with his cousin Mr. Phelan,
an attorney of Liberal politics, McNally, with a significant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>wink, accosted him, saying: 'The people are at last beginning
to read; those who cannot yet read have books and papers
read to them; after they read they will think, and they won't
be long thinking until they act.'</p>

<p>On the trial of Sheridan and Kirwan, two Catholic delegates,
he spoke warmly against the sheriff and others tampering
with the jury, and was checked by the bench. He excused
himself by saying 'that where the heart and the understanding
went together it was difficult to keep bounds,' etc. Great
excitement prevailed by the effort made to crush the freedom
of speech, in the midst of which Percy Bysshe Shelley came
to Dublin, and largely helped by voice and pen to make the
crisis historic. Mr. Pole declared in Parliament, that 'if
gentlemen would read the debates of the Catholic Committee
they would find separation openly and distinctly recommended.'
O'Connell, on February 29, 1812, replied: 'Why, my lord,
this is a direct accusation of high treason, and he who would
assert it of me, I would brand with the foulest epithets. I
defy the slightest proof to be given of its veracity.' The
Duke of Richmond, then Viceroy, writes at great length to
the Home Secretary, speaks of his 'secret information,' and
flutters the Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>It was during the same year that Roger O'Connor, of
Dangan Castle&mdash;father of Feargus, member for Nottingham&mdash;headed
a band of rude retainers and robbed the Galway mail
coach on Cappagh Hill. Though somewhat daft, he had method
in his system, and when, five years later, he found himself
a prisoner in Newgate, pending the long averted prosecution,
he directed his attorney, named Maguire, to draw up a fictitious
case, including a false line of defence, and lay it before
McNally, taking for granted that he would betray to the
Crown the person he supposed to be his client. The prosecution
strangely broke down, and O'Connor, although notoriously
guilty, was acquitted.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> This trial took place in 1817:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>the death of Curran followed soon. A man named Waring
having been indicted for perjury, McNally is found saying:
'Oppressed by the loss of my earliest friend, I have not
strength for the task. But I wish to repel the stigma thrown
out against my client, though I should die in the trammels.'<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>The letters of McNally to Curran would be curious to read;
'but,' writes his daughter-in-law, 'they were destroyed by
my late husband when he became so disgusted by the knowledge
of the double face McNally must have worn for so many
years as the <em>friend</em> of his father.'<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>Although McNally's are destroyed, some characteristic
letters from Curran to him were supplied by the spy to
Curran's biographer. It was a constant effort of McNally
to engraft himself on the fame and name of Curran. A
touching document in the romance of real life is the letter
addressed by Curran to McNally in 1810. He exhibits a kind
solicitude for the improved health of his false friend, and
alludes to their future meeting where secrets and sorrow
would be no more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Godwin's, 41, Skinner Street, London.</p>

<p>Dear Mac,&mdash; ... I am glad to hear you are letting yourself
out at Old Orchard; you are certainly unwise in giving up such an
inducement to exercise, and the absolute good of being so often in
good air. I have been talking about your habit without naming
yourself. I am more persuaded that you and Egan<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> are not sufficiently
afraid of weak liquors.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> I can say from trial how little
pains it costs to correct a bad habit. On the contrary, poor nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>&mdash;like
an ill-used mistress&mdash;is delighted with the return of our
kindness, and is anxious to show her gratitude for that return by
letting us see how well she becomes it.</p>

<p>I am the more solicitous upon this point from having made this
change, which I see will make me waited for in Heaven longer than
perhaps they looked for. If you do not make some pretext for
lingering, you can have no chance of conveying me to the wherry;
and the truth is, I do not like surviving old friends. I am somewhat
inclined to wish for posthumous reputation; and if you go
before me, I shall lose one of the most irreclaimable of my trumpeters.
Therefore, dear Mac, no more water, and keep the other element,
your wind, for the benefit of your friends. I will show my gratitude
as well as I can, by saying handsome things of you to the saints and
angels before you come. Best regards to all with you.</p>

<p class="right">J. P. C.</p></div>

<p>'Mac' stuck to him like a leech to the end. 'As he walked
through the grounds of his country seat with Mr. McNally,'
writes Curran's son, 'he spoke of the impending event with
tranquillity and resignation:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Curran's will, which I have in the house,' writes his
daughter-in-law, 'is dated September 14th, 1816, and the
codicil the 5th September, 1817; it bears the signatures (as
witnesses) of Richard Lonergan and Leonard McNally.
Lonergan was editor of 'Carrick's Morning Post,' a popular
organ. The first of a series of papers on the Dublin Theatre,
signed 'L. M. N.,' appears in this journal of December 16,
1817:&mdash;</p>

<p>A moral, well-acted play [he writes] is of more real benefit to
Society at large than all the inflated harangues of puritanical declaimers.

or their intellectual powers strained by continued study.</p>

<p>The elder Farran began his career in Dublin, and
McNally's criticism helped to make it a success. Mrs. Edwin,
Miss Walstein, Fullam, Williams, Young, all were cleverly
reviewed. It was not necessary, he said, for a tragedian to
roar like a lion, or for a comedian to grin as through a
horse-collar. Two letters signed 'L. M. N.' espouse the part
of Mrs. Edwin, who had met with some unkindness. The
concluding sentence is characteristic: 'Allow me, madam,
to inform you, that while I continue your Panegyrist, you
shall never know me. All old men are more or less eccentric.
I have my whims, and one of them is a dislike to being
thanked for doing what I think to be my duty.'</p>

<p>Friendly relations were established between the popular
journalist and his contributor, but at last they seem a little
strained. The paper got into trouble with a very formidable
enemy to popular principles, Jack Giffard, known as the 'Dog
in Office.' The officiousness of McNally, if he had no deeper
design, is shown by Lonergan in a hurried leader of September
17, 1818&mdash;the italics are his:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. John Giffard</span> <em>versus</em> <span class="smcap">the 'Morning Post.'</span>
</p>

<p>We did not and could not anticipate that an attempt would be
made to induce the Recorder to fix on a day for the trial, so early as
Thursday (this day!). Now, it is certainly not our intention that
one hour's unnecessary delay should take place on the part of the
proprietor of this paper, in meeting the Corporators face to face in
Court, or elsewhere. It was, however, extraordinary, that a day so
very early should be sought for, and that the motion should be
made at a time when we could have no notice of even the Bills being
found! This prosecution, in other respects <em>unique</em>, is equally unprecedented,
we believe, in this <em>extreme</em> anxiety to hurry the business
forward. The Recorder did not countenance this very suspicious
haste. Like an upright judge, he guarded the interests of the absent.</p>

<p>He said it was of little consequence whether a day was fixed or
not, as he supposed the case would be put off until next sessions.</p>

<p>Mr. M‚ÄòNally&mdash;'I understand, My Lord, they do not intend to
traverse in <em>prox</em>. <em>Suppose your Lordship says Thursday next.</em>'</p>

<p>Recorder&mdash;'No, Mr. M‚ÄòNally. <em>I cannot fix a day for the trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>

reason, that I can perceive, for such haste.</em>'</p>

<p>We have made this extract from one of the newspapers. If it
be correct, may we ask Mr. M‚ÄòNally <em>who instructed him to speak
for us</em>? We had no counsel or agent present&mdash;how then could the
worthy gentleman, with all his shrewdness and sagacity, <em>understand</em>
what was our intention? Mr. M‚ÄòNally, finding that nobody present
was authorised to speak in our behalf, as <i lang="la">amicus curi√¶</i>, we suppose,
states to the Court our intention; but how Mr. M‚ÄòNally discovered
that intention, it puzzles us to find out, for Mr. M‚ÄòNally, with all
his legal knowledge and abilities, is no conjuror. We wait then to
hear from this gentleman by what authority, he, employed on the
other side, in the absence of counsel or agent for the proprietor of
this paper, did undertake to state to the Recorder what were our
intentions? We think the conduct of Mr. M‚ÄòNally, in this instance,
of a piece with the rest of this curious proceeding.</p></div>

<p>Some legal proceedings are reported by the Dublin papers
of September 18, 1818, as having been instituted by the
histrions of Crow Street Theatre for the recovery of their
salaries. McNally's swaggering pretensions to pose as an
honourable man are amusingly marked. He was counsel for
the lessee, Frederick W. Jones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. MacNally&mdash;Now, Sir, you suppose your profession to be a
very honourable and gentlemanlike employment&mdash;equally respectable
with my own as a barrister. Now, Sir, let me ask you, are you
not a servant?</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone&mdash;Most certainly. I consider myself the servant
of Mr. Jones and the public. But there is higher authority than
mine, for the Lord Chancellor of England declared, at an investigation
of the affairs of Drury-lane Theatre, that all the performers
were servants, and must be paid before any other creditor.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor instantly ordered Mr. Gladstone his money.</p></div>

<p>The last important case in which McNally figured was that
of the Wild Goose Lodge murderers at Dundalk. This case,
highly tragic in its nature, has been invested with thrilling
interest by the powerful pen of Carleton.</p>

<p>'From grave to gay' marked his course on circuit. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
glimpse of the 'chaff' which followed McNally at mess is
shown by Charles Phillips.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was a common practice with the juniors to play upon his vanity
by inducing him to enumerate the vast sums he made by 'Robin
Hood.' The wicked process was thus. They first got him to fix
the aggregate amount; and then, luring him into details, he invariably,
by third nights and copyright, quintupled the original.
Woe to the wight, however, luckless enough to have been detected
in this waggery. He was ready with his pistol.</p></div>

<p>Phillips also describes 'Mac' as ever varying in his account
of how he lost his thumbs, and that one night, tired and perplexed
by repeated questioning on the point,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> he at last
exclaimed, 'I don't know how I lost them!' It seems to me
that 'Mac' was too cool and cunning to trip. Phillips, as
a most distinguished co-operator with the Catholic Board,
was a man worth McNally's while to 'draw'; and the hoary-headed
'father,' in encouraging the juniors' chaff, probably
feigned features which he did not possess. We have seen how
resolutely incredulous Phillips stood when the spy's real character
was first impugned. Phillips is remembered by the
English bar as a very cunning man. But as regards McNally's
treachery he died unconvinced. The man whose seeming
simplicity he loved to chaff was of deeper acumen. The
'Metropolis,' a review of the Bar, printed in 1805, indicated
among McNally's gifts&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">With all he saw or learned his memory fraught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acute perception of his neighbour's thought.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Phillips seemed to pity the awkward simplicity of his
venerable friend; but it was clearly McNally's game at times
to pose as a 'butt,' and Charles adds no more than the truth in
saying, 'his eyes and voice pierced you through like arrows.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>sings 'the Alphabet of the Bar.' But it is McNally's speeches
as a democratic orator, delivered on all great national occasions,
in which he appears to best dramatic effect.</p>

<p>The mission of General d'Evereux to Ireland, with the
object of raising troops for Bolivar&mdash;the South American
patriot&mdash;took place in 1819, and with it is involved McNally's
last important acts of espionage. A military passion had
seized on the popular mind. For many weeks the streets of
Dublin, gay with plumage, reminded one of Paris during the
Napoleonic fever. The city swarmed with stalwart, ruddy
youths, clad in uniforms of green and gold, their swords
clanking at every step. Lev√©es were held by D'Evereux with
all the pomp of a court; public banquets sought to do him
honour. At first these things caused alarm at Dublin Castle;
but, finally, it was decided that the statute which forbade
foreign enlistment might be suffered to lie dormant: after all,
the opportunity was not a bad one to rid the land of those
military spirits whose presence could never conduce to its
repose. In this connection Dr. Scallan has something to
say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The badge of the United Irishmen worn by Lord Edward
Fitzgerald, and taken from his remains when he lay dead in Newgate,
was given by Leonard McNally to General d'Evereux, who
recruited a number of Irishmen and drilled them, and formed a
regiment with which he sailed to Venezuela, and there attacked the
Spaniards and drove them from the country and freed the Venezuelans
from the Spanish yoke, which had grown into an intolerable
tyranny. The badge has attached to it a paper on which is the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>'From Leonard MacNally, Barrister at-law, to General
d'Evereux of the Irish Legion, raised by him for emancipating the
oppressed inhabitants of South America, and punishing their
Tyrants. 20 July, 1819.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>This presentation would appear to be one of the, no doubt,
many acts of McNally done for the purpose of concealing his
perfidy and gaining his ends.</p>

<p>My father-in-law, Laurence Esmonde White, of Scarnagh, exerted
himself very much in assisting to procure men and officers for the
Legion; and very successfully, as he had much influence with the
people of the County Wexford, in which he always resided, and
where his family had extensive estates. General D'Evereux gave
him several tokens of his gratitude, of which the badge of Lord
Edward was one. He also gave him a deed of gift, witnessed by
his military secretary, of 200,000 acres of land in Venezuela.
Which deed I have; but no one went there to take possession
of the land, and it would seem to be lost through neglect. An old
friend of mine (now deceased) who travelled much in that country,
told me that the land was worth at least 50,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p>I never could understand how the badge could have got into
the possession of McNally, until his perfidy was revealed by
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Then all was made clear. He, no doubt, obtained
the badge from his paymasters in order that he might use
it as he did.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p></div>

<p>During the passage from Dublin to Venezuela dissensions
arose among the officers, and some came back complaining
that they had been misled in the business. D'Evereux
returned to justify his conduct, and a committee, consisting
of Lord Cloncurry, with Counsellors Curran, McNally and
Phillips, was appointed to inquire and report.</p>

<p>In 1820 Ireland lost her Grattan.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The man who had
long shadowed him vanished at the same time. Catholics
may care to know, though they will hardly attach much importance
to the accession, that Leonard McNally, 'after life's
fitful fever,' sank into the bosom of Rome. Father Smith, of
Townsend Street Chapel, on February 13, 1820, gave him the
last rites. This priest, having got word that 'the Counsellor'
wished to see him, went to his house in Harcourt Street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>where Mrs. McNally informed him that her husband was then
asleep, and must not be disturbed. McNally's son, who happened
to be coming down stairs at the moment, reproved his
step-mother for the indisposition she evinced to admit the
clergyman, adding, 'Can't you let him go to the devil his
own way?'<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> He then conducted the priest to the sick man's
room. Father Smith put on his stole, and heard muttered
from the parched lips of Leonard McNally a general confession,
embracing the frailties of his youth and the sins of his
manhood. Contrition was manifested, and the priest gave
him absolution.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Within an hour McNally was dead. In life
he had been no coward, but the death-bed was no place to
show old instincts. His funeral <em>cort√®ge</em> wended its way to
the old graveyard of Donnybrook, where his bones now lie,
near those of Dr. Madden, the historian of the 'United Irishmen.'</p>

<p>McNally had married Miss Janson, the heroine of his
famous lyric, 'Sweet lass of Richmond Hill;' but it was his
second wife, <em>n√©e</em> Edgeworth, who appeared to Father Smith.
The son had acquired a rough reputation, and having been
once robbed near Rathcoole, his father asked Parsons, 'Did
you hear of my son's robbery?' and received for reply, 'No,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>whom did he rob?' This son died in 1869, leaving no representative.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>An action was brought by old McNally's administrator
regarding the house in which he died. 'I was present at
the trial,' writes 'Rebellion Smyth,' an aged correspondent.
'Judge Burton gave McNally a high character for legal learning
and worldly simplicity. "In the affairs of the world" said
Burton, "he was as simple as a child."'<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The eminent judge
for once was mistaken.</p>

<p>Grattan's name has been mentioned by McNally as privy
to the plans of 1798. What truth may be in the assertion
that Grattan would join in an appeal to arms is a point which
may never be fully determined. It is certain that in 1782 he
would not have hesitated to employ physical force. His friend
Mr.&mdash;afterwards Justice&mdash;Day records of him that 'Grattan
was resolved to assist, even by arms, if driven to it, the liberties
of Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Neither Grattan<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> nor Curran were United Irishmen [writes
Macnevin shortly before his death]. It was known in the event of
success Grattan would have accepted an important appointment in
the new Government; but Curran was continually consulted by
them, knew everything that was going on, and his whole heart was
in the cause.</p></div>

reports him to Cooke: 'Counsellor McNally told me this night at Parisoll's, that

put him down.'&mdash;Francis Higgins to Cooke, November 18, 1797. MSS.

the usual sentences, and these were sometimes commuted into banishment,

likely to have delivered the defiant reply which he claims to have done. On
May 24, 1798, he describes his family as 'all females&mdash;all live in terror.' He
has moved them a short way from Dublin. He hopes that Cooke's interest will
prevent the impending evil of free quarters on his house. It was astutely felt
at Dublin Castle, however, that the more McNally seemed to suffer persecution
for justice sake, the more freely would popular confidence be reposed in him.
On June 27, 1798, he writes to Cooke, bitterly complaining that his house had
been attacked by soldiers, who refused to respect Castlereagh's protection.'</p></div>

as 1805, 'J. W.' writes, in one of his undated letters: 'Smith, the priest whom
I have before mentioned, informed me last night that a person arrived here
from France within these few days. The intelligence he brings is an assurance
of a Descent by the French, and that the Fleet is now in the Atlantic with this
object. I do not give credence to his Information. I found it impossible to
extract particulars or names, but I am to see him to-morrow (Sunday).'
</p>
<p>
Smith, suspecting McNally to be a spy, is likely to have charged his news
with sensationalism, and 'Mac,' no doubt, found him useful as a scout. That
he was an open-mouthed gossiping man, his account of his very solemn mission
to the death-bed of the spy shows. He never received promotion, and in the
end became so deaf that when officiating in his confessional he always
reiterated audibly the character of the sin disclosed, so as to be sure he heard
it correctly, and the result was very painful embarrassment to such neighbouring
worshippers as could not fail to become <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with the conscience of
the penitent. Compare <cite>Wellington Correspondence (Ireland)</cite>, pp. <a href="#Page_192">192</a>-3, and the

Leonard McNally's people were engaged in trade; but, according to their tombstone
at Donnybrook, they once owned the castle and lands of Rahobeth. Like
other Irish gentry of the proscribed faith, they sank during penal times, and
the name of Leonard McNally is found in the official list of 'Papists' who 'conformed'
early in the reign of George III. How this came about is traceable in
Sheil's notice of McNally in 1820: 'His grandfather made a very considerable
personal property, which he laid out in building in Dublin; but having taken
leases liable to the discovery of this property, in consequence of a bill under the
popish laws, he was stripped of it. His father died when he was an infant, at
which time the bill of discovery was filed, and little attention was paid to
his education.' The 'will of Leonard McNally, Dublin, merchant,' who died in
1756, is preserved at the Record Office.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

FATHER ARTHUR O'LEARY</h2>


<p>Dr. Madden, in a well-known work of considerable authority,
singles out three divines as examples of noble qualities: <em>i.e.</em>
'the Right Rev. Dr. Doyle, the Rev. Arthur O'Leary, and
Archbishop Murray.'<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>Several years ago an influential journalist posted at
Melbourne the following letter. He was the mouthpiece of
many. It is rather late to answer his question publicly; but,
in truth, the subject was not an inviting one to touch, especially
as, not having studied it, I felt unable to reply in a way
which would be deemed satisfactory by the querist. On the
other hand, the application having come from the antipodes,
I am encouraged to think that the subject possesses an interest
not confined to a hemisphere. 'No one was more generally
loved and revered than Father O'Leary,' writes Charles
Butler. Yelverton, speaking in the Irish Parliament, said:
'Unattached to this world's affairs, Father O'Leary can have
none but the purest motives of rendering service to the cause
of morality and his country.' He was the subject of a grand
panegyric from the pulpit. Two biographies of him have been
written by anointed hands. Idolised while living, his memory
was cherished by thousands. His name wore a halo! Now,
according to recent commentators, it seems not free from that
light which floats over unhealthy places. Let it not be denied
that at different times O'Leary did good work for his creed
and country. As a religionist he continued true to the end;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
but if we accept the high testimony of Froude and Lecky, the
same cannot be said of him as a patriot and a gentleman.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">38, William Street, Melbourne, December 1, 1875.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Knowing you from your published writings to be intimately
acquainted with the secret political history of Ireland at the
close of the last century, I venture to trespass on your courtesy,
with a query relative to a celebrated character of those times, whose
name, long gratefully and affectionately remembered by his countrymen,
must in future, if the statements of a recent historian are
deserving of any credit, be associated only with the names of the
wretches whom, in the pages of 'The Sham Squire' and 'Ireland
before the Union,' you have held up to the scorn of posterity!</p>

<p>I allude to the famous 'Father O'Leary,' who, according to
Mr. Froude, was a spy of Pitt's, systematically employed in betraying
the secrets which his sacred calling and influence as a
trusted patriot enabled him to become possessed of; and, with unparalleled
audacity and baseness, publicly receiving the encomiums
of his most distinguished contemporaries, such men as Grattan and
Curran, for virtues which he only assumed, and for talents which
he so basely prostituted! Is it possible that this man could have
played such an odious part? Do you consider, sir, that the evidence
produced by Mr. Froude in support of so terrible an accusation is
sufficiently conclusive; or, has that sensational writer in this, as
perhaps in other instances, accommodated his facts to his theories?<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
With tantalising reticence Mr. Froude gives only a few meagre
lines from the correspondence in which he claims to have found the
proofs of O'Leary's guilt. The subject has been much discussed in
Australia, as no doubt it has in every country in which Irishmen
are to be found. You have yourself, in one of your ...<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> volumes,
referred to a mysterious connection between O'Leary and William
Pitt. Was it an honourable, or an infamous one?</p>

<p>May I ask you to favour me with your opinion upon it, judged
by the light of Mr. Froude's revelations? By kindly complying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>with my request, you will oblige many anxious inquirers at the
'Antipodes.'</p>

<p class="right">
I am, Sir, etc.,<br />
<span class="smcap">Morgan McMahon</span>.</p>
<p>
W. J. Fitzpatrick, Esq.
</p>
</div>

<p>I may at once say that, although evidence exists of
O'Leary's frailty, it is not sufficient to warrant, in all details,
the very sensational picture drawn by Mr. McMahon.</p>

<p>People always knew that O'Leary became entitled to a
pension, though how he acquired it was not so clear. Perhaps
it is only fair to give him the benefit of the version which his
intimate friend, Francis Plowden, placed on record eighty
years ago.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> His information was, doubtless, derived from
O'Leary himself; but O'Leary seems to have told him no more
than it was convenient to reveal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>O'Leary's writings on toleration had removed from the minds
of many Catholics the difficulties which up to that time prevented
them from swearing allegiance to the House of Hanover, and
abjuring the House of Stuart. That Rev. Divine so happily blended
a vein of liberality and original humour with orthodox instruction,
that his writings became popular even with Protestants, and induced
so much toleration and cordiality between them and the Catholics,
that created a serious alarm in those who studied to perpetuate
their division and consequent weakness. With much art they endeavoured
to stop the progress of this terrifying liberality and
harmony among Irishmen of different religious professions. The
Rev. Arthur O'Leary was thanked by the British minister for the
services he had rendered to the State, by frightening away the
bugbear of Jacobitism, and securing the allegiance of the whole
Catholic body to the House of Hanover. A pension of 200<em>l.</em> was
granted to him for his life in the name of a trustee, but upon the
secret condition that he should for the future withhold his pen, and
reside no more in Ireland,&mdash;in such dread was holden an evangeliser
of tolerance and brotherhood in that country. Two or three payments
of this hush-money were made. Afterwards an arbitrary
refusal for many years threw the Rev. Pensioner upon the voluntary
support of his friends for subsistence. After a lapse of many years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>by importunity and solicitation, and repeated proofs of his having
complied with the secret conditions, he received a large arrear; and,
in order to make himself independent for the rest of his days, he
purchased with it an annuity for his life from a public office, and
died before the first quarter became due.</p></div>

<p>It was, in fact, entirely by Plowden's intervention that the
arrear was paid. So we learn on the authority of the Rev.
Thomas England, who in 1822 brought out a life of O'Leary.
Plowden was a friend of Pitt's, and undertook to write a
History of Ireland under the auspices of that statesman. He
had previously published in defence of the British Constitution,
and received in acknowledgment the
D.C.L. of Oxford. When
writing eighty years ago of so popular and respected a priest
as O'Leary, Plowden&mdash;himself a Catholic&mdash;made his revelation
cautiously. It would now seem that some greater service was
rendered than the public service to which Plowden refers. It
will be shown on high contemporary authority that the object
of the Castle in 1784 was to divide the two great parties.
This policy later on was boldly avowed as <i lang="la">Divide et impera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
The service, therefore, for which O'Leary accepted secret pay
cannot have been for promoting cordial co-operation between
Catholics and Protestants.</p>

<p>Mr. Lecky, in the sixth volume of his 'History of England,'
has brought to light a letter, going far to establish the fact
that in 1784 O'Leary 'consented, for money, to discharge an
ignominious office for a Government which despised and distrusted
him.'<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>On studying O'Leary's public life there seems no doubt
that the secret pension of 100<em>l.</em> a year, which in 1784 he
agreed to accept, was merely supplemental to a larger subsidy
previously enjoyed. How he earned the first pension is now
to be shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>A volume, 'Sketches of Irish Political Characters,' was
published in 1799. The writer, Henry McDougall, commanded
sources of information which gave his book value.
Speaking of O'Leary, he says (p. <a href="#Page_264">264</a>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the most awful period of the American War, he addressed
his Catholic countrymen, upon the subject of what ought to be
their political conduct, in a manner that merited the thanks of
every good citizen, and for which, it has been said, Government
rewarded him with a pension; if so, never was a pension more deservedly
applied.</p></div>

<p>McDougall doubtless refers to a publication of O'Leary's,
largely circulated and often reprinted, <em>i.e.</em> 'An Address to the
Common People of Ireland on occasion of an apprehended
Invasion by the French and Spaniards in July 1779,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> when
the united Fleets of Bourbon appeared in the Channel.' On
April 12, 1779, Spain had concluded an alliance with France and
America, whereupon Vergennes, the French Premier, divulged
to the Spanish minister, Blanca, that an invasion of Ireland
was meditated. To promote this design, an American agent
was instructed to foster the interests of the allies amongst
the Presbyterians of Ulster; while the task of winning over
the Irish Catholics was to be entrusted to Spanish agents.</p>

<p>America was all but lost at this time, and England found
herself in a position of great difficulty. Ireland was drained
of its garrison; the people much discontented; the Catholic
middle classes, grown rich by commercial success, had established
branches of their houses in France and Spain. A
letter of warning, which alarmed the Cabinet, and probably led
them to ask O'Leary's help, still exists. At the same time,
hurriedly and with a bad grace, they conceded a measure of
Catholic Relief. Lord Amherst, writing to Lord North from
Geneva on June 19, 1778, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have acquired a piece of information here, concerning a plot
for a revolt in the West of Ireland among the Roman Catholics,
with a view to overturn the present Government, by the aid of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>French and Spaniards, and to establish such an one as prevails in
this country, I mean the Cantons, by granting toleration to the
Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> You may depend on its authenticity.</p></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My intelligence comes from Rome, and I am pretty certain these
Acts have been brought in from the ministry receiving the same intelligence,
which I know they have been in possession of for some time;
as the measures for preventing the mischief proposed by the person
who gives the information are exactly those that have been adopted.</p></div>

<p>O'Leary by his address aroused not only Catholic loyalty,
but awakened the apathy of many Protestants on whom the
report of invasion had previously made no impression. The
Volunteers sprang into vitality, and though they at first
numbered merely 8,000, the force swelled ere the year was out
to 42,000 armed men, and without the cost of one shilling to
the Crown. Years after, the Government dreading, like
Frankenstein, the heaving mass it had helped to create,
sought to suppress the Irish Volunteers; but in 1778 their
feeling was very different, when O'Leary's inspiring address
fanned the spirit of volunteering, and conduced to preserve
the country. It was then that Lord Buckinghamshire officially
declared that Ireland was prepared to offer a determined
resistance to invasion.</p>

<p>A link or two of the heavy penal chain had now been struck
from Papist limbs. The relaxation, however, was hampered
with a new test oath, drawn up in terms even more subtle than
that which, when handed to O'Connell fifty years later in
Parliament, he withdrew rather than take. Dr. Carpenter<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
ruled the R. C. see of Dublin at this time. His flock embraced
a considerable number who, from timidity of conscience,
expressed doubts as to the propriety of taking the oath.
Dr. Carpenter, though himself no great friend to the temporal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>power of the Pope, felt that to deny on oath a power already
claimed by some famous theologians would seem rash and
arrogant. Bishop de Burgo, author of the 'Hibernia Dominicana,'
opposed the oath in terms still stronger; lay orators
described as a poisoned cup the proffered measure of Catholic
relief. Again O'Leary came to the front. A pamphlet of
eighty-six pages was thrown on the country, entitled, 'Loyalty
asserted, or a Vindication of the new Test Oath of Allegiance,
with an impartial inquiry into the Pope's Temporal Power [a
strong attack upon it] and the claims of the Stewarts to the
English Throne: proving that both are equally groundless.'
O'Leary examined the oath sentence by sentence, and with
logical precision showed its conformity to Catholic teaching.
'The work was widely circulated,' writes Father England, the
first biographer of O'Leary, and called forth as well the
acknowledgments of the friends of the Government as the
warm gratitude of his Catholic fellow-countrymen. In
November 1778 we read that the Catholic Archbishop
Carpenter, at the head of seventy of his clergy, and several
hundred Catholic laymen, attended at the Court of King's
Bench in Dublin and took the oath prescribed.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>The dreaded invasion never took place; but O'Leary's address
was scattered broadcast, and during subsequent years it
reappeared again and again. It reads more like the argument
of a paid advocate than the disinterested appeal of a poor
Franciscan.</p>

<p>All this&mdash;not to speak of O'Leary's tracts on Toleration,
and his exertions, written and oral, to deter the Whiteboys
from their conspiracies&mdash;furnishes sufficient claim to a pension,
without assuming that it must have been earned in the dark
field of espionage. However, we now approach the time when
overtures to discharge an ignominious task were undoubtedly
made to him.</p>

<p>On August 26, 1784, the Viceroy, Rutland, addressed a
'<em>most secret</em>' letter to Pitt's brother-in-law, Lord Sydney:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have discovered a channel by which I hope to get to the
bottom of all the plots and machinations which are contriving in
this metropolis. As I always expected, the disturbances which have
been agitated have all derived their source from French influence.
There is a meeting in which two men named Napper Tandy and
John Binney, together with others who style themselves free
citizens, assemble. They drink the French King on their knees,
and their declared purpose is a separation from England and the
establishment of the Roman Catholic religion. At their meetings
an avowed French agent constantly attends, who is no other than
the person in whose favour the French ambassador desired Lord
Caermarthen to write to me a formal introduction....<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> One of
this meeting, alarmed at the dangerous extent of their schemes, has
confessed, and has engaged to discover to me the whole intentions
of this profligate and unprincipled combination.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p></div>

<p>This is a glowing picture, one more than realising the
beautiful vision of Davis:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mess tent is full, and the glasses are set,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>The first mention of O'Leary's name in the State Papers
is under date September 4, 1784, when Sydney writes to the
Lord-Lieutenant:&mdash;'O'Leary has been talked to by Mr.
Nepean, and he is willing to undertake what is wished for
100<em>l.</em> a year, which has been granted him.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On Sept. 8th [writes Mr. Lecky] Orde thanks Nepean for sending
over a spy, or detective, named Parker, and adds: I am very glad
also that you have settled matters with O'Leary, who can get at the
bottom of all secrets in which the Catholics are concerned, and they
are certainly the chief promoters of our present disquietude. He
must, however, be cautiously trusted, <em>for he is a Priest</em>, and if not
too much addicted to the general vice of his brethren here, he is at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>least well acquainted with the art of raising alarms for the purpose
of claiming a merit in doing them away.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus, as it would seem, O'Leary had already not been slow
in claiming from the Government the merit, if not the wages,
of allaying the causes of public alarm. Plowden and England
admit that O'Leary had a pension of 200<em>l.</em> a year. He
must have been in receipt of at least 100<em>l.</em> for his writings
at the time that, for an extra hundred, it was proposed to
him to undertake a base task. The promptitude and facility
with which Sydney, in September 1784, made the proposition
shows the close relations that had previously subsisted.</p>

<p>A curious letter from Weymouth, a previous Home Secretary,
addressed to Dublin Castle, is printed in Grattan's
'Life' (vol. i. p. <a href="#Page_369">369</a>). In great panic he expresses fear that
the Catholic colleges of France and Flanders would despatch
their <em>alumni</em> as secret agents to Ireland. These were among
the reasons that made the Government anxious to secure
O'Leary's aid.</p>

<p>Dr. England&mdash;his earliest biographer&mdash;lived comparatively
near the time, and heard from O'Leary's publisher, Keating,
a few interesting incidents which, to some extent, tally
with the revelations of the State Papers. The biographer
knows of an interview between O'Leary and Nepean on behalf
of Sydney and Pitt, but England and his informant are deceived
as to the conditions which accompanied the pension.
Their memory is also at fault as regards the year. Instead
of 1784, they set it down as 'soon after O'Leary had fixed his
residence permanently in London,' which, of course, was in
1789. O'Leary had been a good deal in London previously,
for, as Froude states, Orde in 1784 asked Sydney to send him
over confidential agents, and in September 1784 he writes,
'your experts have arrived safe.'<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Soon after he [O'Leary] had fixed his residence permanently in
London [writes Dr. England], one day whilst dining with his attached
and valued friend, Mr. Keating, the bookseller, he was
informed that Lord Sydney's secretary was in the adjoining parlour,
and had a communication to make to him. He immediately left
the table; and when, in a short time, he returned, he related the
substance of the interview. The secretary stated to him that
Government had observed with much satisfaction the good effects
which Mr. O'Leary's writings had produced in Ireland&mdash;peace, good
order, and unanimity, amongst all classes of his countrymen, had
been promoted and advanced by his exertions; and that, in consideration
of the services thus rendered to the Empire, it was determined
to manifest the approbation of such conduct by offering him
a pension suitable to his circumstances, and worthy of his acceptance;
that, with a delicacy arising from the ignorance of his means of
subsistence, they had as yet hesitated fixing on any specific sum,
choosing rather to learn from himself what would answer his expectations,
than to determine on what might be insufficient for his
claims. The secretary took the liberty of asking a question to
which, at the same time, he did not insist on receiving an answer:
whether, in the event of any popular commotion in Ireland, as it
was dreaded would be the case from the diffusion of American
republican notions, O'Leary would advocate, as formerly, principles
of loyalty and allegiance? To this latter question an unhesitating
reply was given, confirmatory of the known inflexibility of O'Leary's
political conduct; with regard to the pension, he never had sought
for one, though, at a former period of his life, something of the
kind had been hinted to him; in the present instance he was
grateful to the Government for the recollection of him, and suggested
that the utmost of his claims would be answered by 100<em>l.</em> a year.
He was afterwards informed officially that his presence in Ireland
was necessary for the purpose of having the pension placed on the
list of that country. He repaired thither, and, after the necessary
formalities were gone through, he became entitled to 200<em>l.</em> per
annum; but England adds that, 'for some unexplained cause, his
pension, after one or two years, was arbitrarily withheld.'<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that the point here made is not consistent
with Plowden's account (<i lang="la">ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_213">213</a>). According to him, the
pension was 'hush-money:' he was to write no more, and,
above all, he was not to write in promotion of good feeling and
toleration. England upholds that it was given in the hope
that O'Leary would continue to write in the same tone that
had already earned Governmental gratitude. Sydney settled
terms with O'Leary in London, and, through his secretary, told
him what to do.</p>

<p>'Cedars have yielded,' says St. Peter. It was a clever
thought to plan the corruption of O'Leary for the performance
of a part which his employers describe with gusto. Two years
previously, on February 27, 1782, popular confidence in him
had reached its height when Yelverton, Grattan, and Sir
Lucius O'Brien praised him with enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A man of learning, a philosopher, a Franciscan [said Grattan]
did the most eminent service to his country in the hour of its
greatest danger. He brought out a publication that would do
honour to the most celebrated name. The whole kingdom must
bear witness to its effect by the reception they gave it. Poor in
everything but genius and philosophy, he had no property at stake,
no family to fear for; but descending from the contemplation of
wisdom, and abandoning the ornaments of fancy, he humanely
undertook the task of conveying duty and instruction to the lowest
class of the people.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p></div>

<p>How he qualified for these praises Mr. Froude may now
be allowed to show. After O'Leary arrived in Dublin he saw
Orde, and was told what the Government expected him to do.
The following letter is dated September 23, 1784:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your experts have arrived safe [wrote the Secretary, reporting
their appearance]. At this moment we are about to make
trial of O'Leary's sermons,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and Parker's rhapsodies. They may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>both in their different callings of very great use. The former, if
we can depend on him, has it in his power to discover to us the
real designs of the Catholics, from which quarter, after all, the real
mischief is to spring. The other can scrape an acquaintance with
the great leaders of sedition, particularly Napper Tandy, and
perhaps by that means dive to the bottom of his secrets.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p></div>

<p>Sir Richard Musgrave was one of the alarmists who loved
to purvey sensational news for Dublin Castle. His 'History
of the Rebellion,' published in 1801, embodies his impressions
of events for twenty years before. No wonder that Dublin
Castle was fluttered by his reports. Here is clearly one
of them, and it serves to show why it was that the Government
were so anxious in 1784 to secure O'Leary by a subsidy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A corps called the Irish Brigade was raised in Dublin, of which
nineteen out of twenty were Roman Catholics, and they appointed
Father O'Leary, an itinerant friar, their chaplain. I have been
assured that they exceeded in number all the other Volunteer corps
in the city.</p></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the summer of the year 1783, the Irish Brigade, with the
Dublin Independent Volunteers, commanded by James Napper
Tandy and Matthew Dowling, formed an encampment between
Roebuck and Dublin, under the pretext of studying tactics and
learning camp duty, though it was well known that they were
hatching revolutionary projects. It is to be observed that the
war, the only pretext for their arming, was now at an end; yet
many corps in different parts of the kingdom resolved not to lay
down their arms but with their lives.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p></div>

<p>Musgrave's construction of the above, as in many other
incidents, is not wholly correct; though in his estimate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>Tandy and Dowling, both Protestants, he was accurate
enough.</p>

<p>If O'Leary played the part assigned and attributed to him,
never did face more belie internal baseness, or was more
exquisitely fashioned to command the confidence of its dupes.
The 'Gentleman's Magazine' for February 1802 contains a
study of 'Father Arthur' from the pen of Mr. Pratt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His manners [he says] were the most winning and artless,
anticipating his goodwill and urbanity before he opened his lips;
and when they were opened, his expressions did but ratify what
those manners had before ensured. And you had a further earnest
of this in the benign and ineffable smile of a countenance so little
practised in guile that it at the same time invited to confidence,
and denoted an impossibility of your being betrayed.</p></div>

<p>Curran, addressing the Irish House of Commons in 1787,
revealed a trait highly honourable to the friar: 'Mr. O'Leary
was, to his knowledge, a man of the most innocent and
amiable simplicity of manners in private life. The reflection
of twenty years in a cloister had severely regulated his
passions and deeply informed his understanding.'<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Curran's
knowledge was partly derived from the fact that O'Leary
belonged to 'The Monks of the Screw,' often regarded as a
convivial club; but 'whose more important object,' writes
Hardy, the biographer of Charlemont, 'was a co-operation of
men holding a general similarity of political principles resolved
to maintain the rights and constitution of their country.'
Previously, O'Leary had dedicated his Miscellaneous Tracts
'to the Dignitaries and Brethren of the Monks of St. Patrick,'
addressing them, with his wonted humour, as 'Reverend
Fathers and illustrious Brethren.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>He had already written in denunciation of French designs
on Ireland; and what more natural than that he should now
be asked to track the movements of certain French emissaries
which the Government heard had arrived in Dublin, and
were conspiring with the Catholic leaders to throw off the
British yoke.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> This task O'Leary, as a staunch loyalist, may
have satisfied his conscience in attempting, especially as he
must have known that in 1784 the Catholics, as a body, had
no treasonable designs, though, doubtless, some few exceptions
might be found. In fact, his friend Edmund Burke, a member
of the Ministry in 1783, declared, but later on, that 'the Irish
Roman Catholics were everywhere loyal, save at certain
points where their loyalty had been impaired by contact with
Protestants.' Orde,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> while using O'Leary, thought him a
knave; yet feigned a readiness to believe his reports. The
exhaustive correspondence of Count d'Adh√©mar, the French
ambassador in London, with his Government, is now open to
inquirers at the French Foreign Office; but, as it makes no
allusion to any French agent in Ireland at this period, the
story may be little better than one of the sensational myths
so often found in the letters of informers to the Irish
executive.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> But, although no documental evidence exists of
a French agent having been in Dublin in 1784, it is certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>that five years later, <em>i.e.</em> in 1789, one Bancroft, an American
by birth, was sent on a secret mission from France to Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>We hear of no important arrests during the troubled period
that O'Leary is said to have been set in motion; but the
Habeas Corpus Act had not been suspended since 1779, and
was not until 1794 that Pitt renewed the suspension.</p>

<p>In analysing O'Leary's life and judging his conduct, it is
not fair to ignore any remark of his tending to exculpate; but, if
panegyrics are desired, the reader should consult the memoirs
by England, Buckley and some others. Almost O'Leary's last
public performance appeared in 1800: 'An Address to the
Lords of Parliament, with an account of Sir H. Mildmay's
Bill relative to Nuns.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His loyalty was not [he said] the effect of necessity or timeserving
policy, for in France, where the Penal Laws of England
drove him for education, and where the Catholics of Ireland had
Seminaries and Convents with full admission to all the degrees of
her universities, I <em>resisted every solicitation to enlist any of the
subjects of these kingdoms in the French King's service</em>, though I had
then every opportunity of being appointed to superintend prisons
and hospitals during the wars. It was my interest to recommend
myself to the favour of people in power, and consequently more my
interest to become more a courtier than a moralist. St. Paul calls
God to witness when he asserts the truth: I can do the same
when I assert that conscience was the rule of my conduct.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p></div>

<p>This is further useful in showing that O'Leary was no
admirer of the French king, and now that he was a pensioner
of England would hardly object to discover the reported
French agents in Dublin, who, with Napper Tandy, are said
to have 'drank on their knees' the toast of 'Louis of France.'</p>

<p>The latter story&mdash;told by the Viceroy, Rutland, in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>letter to Sydney&mdash;bears improbability on its face. It seems
strange that Tandy and his party, who not long after were
Red Republicans and the allies of Carnot and Hoche, would
drink the health of Louis XVI. on their knees.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> They were
principally Protestants; and John O'Connell, in the Life
of his father, says that Sheares shocked the future Liberator
by exultantly displaying a handkerchief soaked in the French
king's blood.</p>

<p>I suspect that when O'Leary returned from making, in
September 1784, the inquiries which he is assumed to have
done, his report was something in the spirit of Canning's
knife-grinder: 'Story! God bless you, I have none to tell,
sir;' and that Orde concluded O'Leary himself was in the
plot. On October 17, Orde writes to Nepean, alluding to
some rumour about our friar which is not stated. 'Del
Campo's connection with O'Leary&mdash;or rather O'Leary's with
him&mdash;may have given rise to all the report; but, after all,
I think it right to be very watchful over the priest, and
wish <em>you</em> to be so over the Minister. They are all of them
designing knaves.'</p>

<p>Thus it appears that in little more than a fortnight after
O'Leary is supposed to have begun to spy, Orde was far from
satisfied with him.</p>

the guilt seems <i lang="la">prim√¢ facie</i> proven, the absence of such letters notwithstanding.
O'Leary was not much of a letter-writer: few of any sort appear in

searched newspaper files and contemporary pamphlets, and I can find no letter,
or reported sermon, addressed by O'Leary to the Whiteboys in 1784. Two
years later, he certainly tried to reason with them. The words 'if we can
depend on him,' lead to the inference that O'Leary gave Orde some personal
assurance as regards his willingness to make the inquiries desired.</p></div>

dealing entirely with the information furnished by a tipsy clerk of Mary's Lane
Chapel to the effect that a general massacre of all the Protestants in Ireland
had been projected! Myths of this sort have periodically scared the executive.
Passing on to 1830, we find, in the Sirr Papers, informations dated December
24 and 27, and disclosing another Popish plot. Among the men alleged to be
deep in the conspiracy were the late saintly Bishop Blake, Brother Syrenus, a
monk, Thomas Reynolds, afterwards city marshal, W. J. Battersby, and a
number of other Catholic laymen. Twenty-three officers&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> young priests

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

ARTHUR O'LEARY IN LONDON</h2>


<p>It is to be regretted that the State Paper naming 'O'Leary
and Del Campo' should be couched in words so brief and
cautious. Mr. Lecky offers no explanation of it. Not only
are we uninformed as to the nature of the 'Report;' but we
are left to guess who Del Campo was. One thing is evident:
Dublin Castle and the Home Office put their heads together,
shook them mysteriously, and then urged extreme caution in
dealing with knaves. Books of biographic reference make no
mention of Del Campo's name; but it is quite clear from
Cumberland's memoirs that Del Campo was the Spanish
minister, next in authority to Florida Blanca.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the year 1780 [writes Cumberland], and about the time of
Rodney's capture of the Caracca fleet, I had opportunities of discovering
through a secret channel of intelligence many things
passing, and some concerting, between the confidential agents of
France and Spain (particularly the latter) resident in this country,
and in private correspondence with the enemies of it. Of these
communications I made that use which my duty dictated and to
my judgment seemed advisable. By these, in the course of their
progress, a prospect was opened of a secret negotiation with the
Minister Florida Blanca, to which I was personally committed, and
of course could not decline the undertaking it.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p></div>

<p>While the American War still raged, and hostilities from
France and Spain continued to threaten, Richard Cumberland,
son of a bishop and the secretary of a former viceroy, started
on his secret mission to the courts of Lisbon and Madrid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
bearing from England letters of accreditation, quite a boxful of
instructions, and accompanied by his wife and daughters 'on
the pretence of travelling into Italy upon a passport through
the Spanish dominions.' Cumberland's interviews with Del
Campo are described, and for a time all went well; but,
owing to terrible rumours as regards the 'No Popery' riots
in London, which now broke out, led by Lord George Gordon,
President of the Protestant Association, the treaty<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> collapsed;
Del Campo refused to appear; Cumberland was recalled, and
the Government who sent him out withheld the repayment
of 5,000<em>l.</em>, the amount of expenses he had incurred.</p>

<p>It may be said that Orde's want of confidence in O'Leary
arose, not because he had furnished so little secret information,
but because of some whisper that the Spanish Minister
had had <em>pourparlers</em> with him. It would be strange if
O'Leary, who in 1779 wrote powerfully against the hostile
designs of Spain, should be suspected, within the next few
years, of abetting them. The rumour, which Mr. Lecky says is
not stated, may have been merely that O'Leary, the only
Catholic writer of intrepidity at that day, had been asked by
Del Campo, who soon after became resident Spanish minister
in London, and was himself of English extraction,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> to write
an exposure of the 'No Popery Riots' and their leaders&mdash;incidents
which Spain, now more than ever defiant in its
pose, could not fail to turn to political account.</p>

<p>A postscript to O'Leary's 'Miscellaneous Tracts' mentions
that he had been requested to give a history of the London
riots. 'I promised to undertake the task,' he writes, 'and
began to digest my materials; but afterwards reflecting that
the duty of the historian bound me to arraign at the impartial
tribunal of truth both men and actions&mdash;unmask the leading
characters,' &amp;c.... he then came to 'consider my own state
exposed in consequence of the Penal Laws to the insult of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>every ruffian, and, comparing the defenceless situation of
the priest with the duty of the historian, I dropped the
attempt.'</p>

<p>These tumults of 1780 lit a flame which did not die out
even with the expiring century. During their height most of
the Roman Catholic chapels of London, especially those of
the foreign embassies, were gutted and burnt. Papists' houses
were attacked, as well as the houses of all persons known to
favour them. For days and nights the mob gained an almost
complete mastery of London, which is described as like a city
taken by storm. The venerable Bishop Challoner was roused
from his sleep and urged to fly; he died soon after of palsy,
the effects of the shock. No man's life was safe who did not
mount the badge of riot, a blue cockade; windows displayed
flags of the same colour; while the watchword 'No Popery'
was prudentially inscribed. Broadsides were circulated under
the auspices of Lord George Gordon&mdash;the unholy high priest
of the holocaust&mdash;in which Englishmen were exhorted to remember
'the bloody tyranny and persecuting plots exercised
on Protestants by Rome'&mdash;the Spanish Armada, of course,
included. Society seemed falling to pieces. From Tyburn
to Whitechapel the highway presented a frontage of mourning.
Every shop was closed. Mr. Archer, a priest, deposed in
court that he had paid 40<em>l.</em> to be allowed to pass through
Fleet Street, and a hackney coachman refused 10<em>l.</em> to drive a
papist to Hampstead. The mob, flushed with victory, now
sought allies in the prisons. Newgate, then recently rebuilt
at a cost of 150,000<em>l.</em>, was attacked with fury; its great gates
fell before them like frail partitions; 500 felons, including those
set free from Clerkenwell, were let loose upon the burning
city, leaving behind them in flames, not the gaol only, but the
whole street.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> It seemed a second 1666, and the famous fall
of the Bastile, nine years later, was but the mere echo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Storm had not as yet burst over Ireland; but the heavy
air was charged with electricity. The following are the
words with which Mr. Froude awakened widespread interest,
and drew forth that missive from the Antipodes given on a
previous page.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If rebellion was meditated [Froude writes], the Government
required fuller knowledge; and 'a new plan of management' had
to be adopted 'to obtain exact information of the conduct and
motives of the most suspected persons.' 'Useful and confidential
agents,' whose silence and fidelity could be relied on, 'who would
write the daily history of a man's motions,' without betraying
himself, were not to be found in Dublin.</p>

<p>The Irish Secretary applied to the English Cabinet to furnish
him from their own staff of informers. Two valuable persons
answering to Mr. Orde's description were sent, and the name of
one of them will be an unpleasant surprise to those already interested
in the history of the time.</p>

<p>They were both Irishmen. One was a skilled detective named
Parker,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> an accomplished orator who could outmouth the noisiest
patriot, and had already some knowledge of the leading agitators.
Orde welcomed this man with a twinge of misgiving. 'I hope he
is discreet,' he wrote, 'for he must to a certain extent be possessed
of the power of hurting us by garrulity or treachery.'<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>The other was no less a person than the celebrated Father
O'Leary, whose memory is worshipped by Irish Catholic politicians
with a devotion which approaches idolatry. O'Leary, as he was
known to the world, was the most fascinating preacher, the most
distinguished controversialist of his time. A priest who had caught
the language of toleration, who had mastered all the chords of
liberal philosophy, and played on them like a master; whose
mission had been to plead against prejudice, to represent his
country as the bleeding lamb, maligned, traduced, oppressed, but
ever praying for her enemies; as eager only to persuade England
to offer its hand to the Catholic Church, and receive in return the
affectionate homage of undying gratitude. O'Leary had won his
way to the heart of Burke by his plausible eloquence. Pitt seemed
to smile on him: it is easy now to conjecture why. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>appeared in the Convention at the Rotunda the whole assembly
rose to receive him. Had such a man been sent over on an open
errand of conciliation, his antecedents would have made the choice
intelligible. But he was despatched as a paid and secret instrument
of treachery, in reply to a request for a trained informer.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
What the Government really thought of Father O'Leary may be
gathered from Orde's language when told to expect him. 'He
could get to the bottom of all secrets in which the Catholics were
concerned,' and Catholics were known to be the chief promoters of
the agitation in Dublin. But he too was to be dealt with cautiously,
for he was a priest. 'They are, all of them,' Orde said, 'designing
knaves;' 'the only good to be derived from them is, perhaps,
to deceive them into an idea that they are believed.'<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p></div>

<p>Sir Jonah Barrington describes Orde as 'a cold, cautious
and sententious man.'<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> These letters in some respects support
that impression. A few years later he was created Lord
Bolton. His letter, announcing O'Leary's arrival at Dublin
on secret service, is dated September 23, 1784.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Let us look
back a little and see what the previous year was doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dungannon Convention, which won great boons for
Ireland, was followed by provincial assemblies in Leinster,
Munster and Connaught. Resolutions were carried, delegates
were appointed, and the nation anxiously awaited the great
Volunteer Convention in Dublin, on which the fate of Ireland
was declared to depend. Meanwhile one hundred and sixty
envoys of the Volunteer army met, electing Lord Charlemont
chairman. Red uniforms fringed the streets, and the delegates,
two by two, marched through the lines, amid the roll
of drums and the waving of national ensigns. The Earl of
Bristol and Bishop of Derry rode to the Convention with an
escort of dragoons.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A distinguished corps of volunteers [writes Mr. Buckley] had
conferred on O'Leary the honorary dignity of chaplain; and we
are assured that many of the measures submitted for consideration
at the great Convention held in Dublin had been previously placed
before him for his opinion as to their prudence and utility. On
that memorable day, when the delegates of a hundred thousand
men met in the Rotunda, with all the pomp and power that an
armed nation could concentrate for a great national purpose, it was
gratifying to the assembled masses of spectators to behold Father
O'Leary, as he entered the building, received at the door by the
entire guard of volunteers with a full salute of rested arms. He
marched up the hall amidst the deafening cheers of the surrounding
delegates, and, in the debate which followed, his name was frequently
mentioned with honour and applause.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p></div>

<p>'Plowden's remarks, which you enclose, do not meet the
specific statements of Froude, that O'Leary was employed as
an informer at the period of the Volunteer Convention,' writes
Mr. Morgan McMahon, my Australian correspondent.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> Mr.
Froude's words certainly tend to convey that the Convention
took place at the time of Orde's application for a spy. The
date of the Convention was November 1783: Orde's letter
was written in September 1784. Again, it is suggested
that O'Leary was despatched in reply to a request for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><em>trained</em> informer. But it does not appear that though he
may have been useful as a diplomatist he was already a spy.
On the contrary, Sydney writes (Sept. 4): 'O'Leary has been
talked to and he is willing to do what is wished for 100<em>l.</em> a
year.' Orde replies (Sept. 8), 'I am very glad that you have
settled matters with O'Leary, who can get to the bottom of
all secrets in which the Catholics are concerned.' O'Leary
had already a pension, ostensibly for his writings; but the
pension for espionage must not be confounded with it.</p>

<p>It is certainly admitted by even O'Leary's panegyrists
that at the period of the Convention of 1783 delicate overtures,
which they assume he rejected, were made to him; but the
magnanimous words supposed to have been used by O'Leary
when parleying with his tempter rest on no authority whatever,
and some will be disposed to suspect that a colour is
imparted to the overtures more presentable to general readers
than the naked truth, whatever it was. The pension, I repeat,
which O'Leary already enjoyed, was, I think, merely for his
writings; though, prior to September 1784, he may have accepted
douceurs for distinct acts of diplomacy. At all events
it is due to O'Leary to give him the full benefit of the
exculpatory words of his brother priest. Describing the
Volunteer Convention, Father Buckley writes, eighty years
later:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During Father O'Leary's visit to Dublin on this occasion, he
was waited on by a gentleman who was well known to be on very
close and friendly relations with the Government of the day.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> The
visit appeared, for some time, to be merely one of ceremony, and
the visitor paid many handsome compliments to the Father on the
style of his writings and their good effect on the public mind.
Soon, however, it was easy to see that diplomacy had more to do
with the visit than etiquette, for the gentleman, in courteous
language, intimated that if Father O'Leary would use his pen in
extolling certain measures just then brought forward by the Administration,
his services would be handsomely requited. O'Leary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>was displeased and indignant at the proposal to barter his patriotism
for a bribe, and conveyed his feelings in no measured phrase. The
request was therefore softened down into an entreaty that he would
at least abstain from writing on those measures in terms of condemnation.
But the minion of the Government knew not with
what manner of man he had to deal. 'I will never be silent,'
warmly exclaimed O'Leary, 'whilst my exertions can be of the
least service to my religion or my country.'<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus far Buckley, the biographer of 1867. England,
O'Leary's biographer of 1822, finishes the interview in less
florid words: 'He was then told that a pension of 150<em>l.</em> per
annum was to be offered for his acceptance, and that no condition
repugnant to his feelings as an Irishman or Catholic
was to be annexed to it. A change in the Administration<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
took place shortly afterwards, and the promise remained unfulfilled.'<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Father England assumes that O'Leary spurned the overtures
at the time of the Convention, though later on his
acceptance of a pension is admitted. While guiltless, no
doubt, of direct betrayal, he may have been led to connive
at a trick by which the Irish Government succeeded in breaking
up the Convention.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>O'Leary, towards the close of his life, had made copious
notes illustrative of the history of Ireland&mdash;notes handed by
him to Plowden, who was glad to interweave them with his
own when compiling 'The Historical Review.' Plowden dismisses
with the following note the great incident of the
Convention:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whilst the business of equal representation was in agitation at
a meeting of the Convention in Dublin, a pretended letter from
Lord Kenmare was produced, purporting to convey the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>sentiments of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, in which they were
made to express their perfect satisfaction with what had been
already done for them, and that they desired no more than peaceably
to enjoy the privileges they had obtained.</p></div>

<p>Catholics thus became excluded from the constitutional
prerogatives claimed for Protestants. The proceedings of
the Convention were at last adjourned <i lang="la">sine die</i>. Sir Boyle
Roche invented the fatal letter, and Mr. Froude conveys that
he was instigated to this course by the Viceroy. Sir Gavan
Duffy states&mdash;as a common belief in Ireland&mdash;that 'had the
Convention not been betrayed by its leaders, the Union would
never have taken place.'<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>O'Leary, though his name, and that of Sir Boyle Roche,
are not mentioned in the printed abstract of the proceedings,
was certainly present when the fictitious letter was read. Dr.
England, describing the demonstration by which O'Leary's
arrival was hailed at the Rotunda, adds that it 'occurred on
the same day on which the message said to be from Lord
Kenmare was read at the Convention,'<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> but no fault is found
with O'Leary by England, who is his invariable eulogist.</p>

<p>Lord Kenmare was a fast friend of our friar,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> and is uniformly
praised by him.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> It was when on a visit to this peer
that O'Leary, seeing a wounded stag approaching Yelverton,
wittily said: 'How naturally instinct leads him to come to
you to deliver him by a <i lang="la">nolle prosequi</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Kenmare, this
leader of the higher class of Catholics, was falsely represented
as announcing at the Convention that his co-religionists were
satisfied with the concessions they had got. I find that
O'Leary had privately expressed, very much to his honour,
but a short time before, an opinion diametrically opposite;
and urging the Catholics not to cease agitation till every link
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>in their fetters had been struck off;<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> but he now held his peace,
and thus wittingly, or otherwise, aided the base schemes of
the Viceroy. O'Leary himself had long been recognised as
the most prominent exponent and mouthpiece of the Catholic
demand; and, from his intimacy with Lord Kenmare, he could
hardly fail to have known his sentiments on a question in
which both were naturally most interested; the forged letter,
however, claiming authority to speak for the Catholics of Ireland,
was allowed to pass unchallenged, to the ruin of the
Convention and the exultant triumph of a faction.</p>

<p>O'Leary and Sir Boyle Roche are not persons likely to have
been intimate; and yet it can be shown that an intimacy did
exist. A letter from O'Leary, written a year before the Convention,
and to be found later on, avows that he was the friend
and political correspondent of Roche.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> The forged letter&mdash;in
which were travestied the opinions and aspirations of the
Catholics of Ireland&mdash;was read on November 11, 1783.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Not
until a fortnight after was the fraud exposed by the popular
Earl-Bishop of Derry, who read a letter from Lord Kenmare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>dated Killarney, Nov. 20, saying, 'I utterly disavow having
given the least authority,'<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> &amp;c., &amp;c. Sir Boyle Roche thereupon
addressed to several leading Catholics a remarkable note
dated 'Dublin Castle, 14th February, 1784.' This document
was, of course, the act of the Administration, Roche having
been merely wound up and used as an automaton. His letter,
seeking to entrap slavish Catholics and sink them in the mire
of unpopularity, began by saying that it would flatter him in
the highest degree 'if I should find that my conduct was not
disapproved by yourself and friends,' and he holds out the hope
that, being once more in Parliament, he would be not unmindful
of Catholic interests.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I had certain intelligence [he adds] that the Bishop of Derry had
leagued himself with some of the unthinking part of the Catholics,
who were in town for the purpose, and that the admission of that
body to the rights of voting for members of Parliament was to be
the first matter agitated in the Convention. I now thought that
the crisis was arrived in which Lord Kenmare<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> and the heads of
the body should step forth to disavow these wild projects, and to
profess their attachment to the lawful powers.... I therefore
resolved on a bold stroke.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p></div>

<p>He adds that he was elated to the greatest degree by his
success, having 'entirely disconcerted the measures of the
leaders of the Convention.'</p>

<p>The Earl-Bishop of Derry was a decided revolutionist and
very eager for separation, and is alleged to have said to Lord
Charlemont, 'Things are going well, my lord: we shall have
blood.' O'Leary, author of 'Loyalty Asserted,' and notoriously
a man of peace, would probably have felt little scruple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>in seeking to avert by diplomatic means what Orde feared
might become a bloody chaos. Burke, writing to a brother
priest of O'Leary's, said, 'Do everything in your power to
check the growth of Jacobinism on the one hand, and oppression,
which is its best friend, on the other.' No wonder that
the Irish Government blenched at the outlook. One Dublin
paper, called the 'Volunteer Journal,' urged assassination;
and some men had been arrested, in the previous spring, on
a charge of conspiring to murder seven unpopular members
of Parliament. The supineness of magistrates and the absence
of any regular police force opened great facilities for
crime. Riots raged in the streets owing to trade strikes; men
were 'tarred and feathered' and let loose before the infuriated
mob; soldiers were houghed and left bleeding on the
pavement. New corps of volunteers advertised for recruits,
and men of the worst repute rushed into their ranks. Meanwhile
the Bishop of Derry was raising a fresh regiment of
volunteers in Ulster. 'The Viceroy, at Fitzgibbon's advice,'
writes Froude, 'sent down officers in disguise to watch him,
with a warrant in their pockets should an arrest be necessary;'
and he adds that 'this singular prelate ran a near chance of
ending his career on the gallows.' The withdrawal from
public life of so remarkable a figure was second only in its
effect to the collapse of the Convention, of which he was the
animating spirit. When, six years later, Bancroft was sent by
France on a secret mission to Ireland, his report, now preserved
in the Foreign Office at Paris, states, as we learn from Lecky,
that the fall of the Convention had 'thrown a certain ridicule
on Irish democracy, and it may be long before it is repaired.'</p>

<p>The Convention belongs to the year 1783. Not until the
autumn of 1784 are any letters found compromising O'Leary&mdash;letters
not revealing any distinct acts of espionage, or even
penned by himself, but showing him to have yielded to the
voice of the tempter.</p>

<p>In judging a man who is not alive to defend himself,
one whose memory has been for a century revered, I am
reluctantly led to encumber this narrative with various con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>siderations
for and against, so that readers may have the
result of a conscientious study of the case, and he able to
form a judicial conclusion.</p>

<p>The promptitude of O'Leary's arrival in Dublin impressed
badly all who read it in Froude; for Orde, according to that
historian, asked the English Secretary of State to send him
over two trained men from their own staff of informers.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
The letter containing this request, however, I have not seen
in print or manuscript. O'Leary came over at the same time
as a detective named Parker; but the alacrity of the priest's
arrival, though it looks badly, may not be altogether due to
his readiness to play the spy. This man, 'poor in everything
save genius and philosophy,' to quote Grattan's words, was
informed, according to England, one of his biographers, that
his presence in Dublin was necessary in order that some
formalities should be gone through ere his name could be
placed on the Irish Civil List.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> England says that a pension
which, during the previous year, he was on the point of
receiving, fell through because of a change in the Cabinet;
and may not this consideration have been in itself enough to
expedite the journey?</p>

<p>O'Leary had been interviewed in London by Sir Evan
Nepean, a practised diplomatist, and consented, we are told,
to come to Dublin to make certain inquiries. But who can
tell what wily words were employed to induce him to wait on
the Irish Secretary, Orde, at Dublin Castle? Orde posed as
a man rather liberal for the time, and was the correspondent
of Grattan and Lord Kenmare. Men of the world know
that very different language is often used when writing <em>of</em> a
person, than when addressing that person direct. On the
other hand it should be remembered, assuming that Sydney
conveys a correct impression of what passed, that O'Leary
seemed willing to accept 100<em>l.</em> for services dealing, not with
the special exigencies of the hour, but on condition that he
continued, from year to year, and for the same annual fee, to
probe to the bottom certain secrets of his party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>When he arrived in Dublin the country was rent by great
and just discontent. One grievance was that Parliament
possessed no adequate representation of the popular voice.
In March 1784, Flood brought in a Bill for 'Reform,' and
twenty-six counties petitioned in its favour.</p>

<p>It had been decided that the Convention<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> of the previous
year should be followed up by a national Congress. This
announcement brought dismay to the Castle. The loss of
her American Colonies had just taught Pitt a lesson. Contemporary
pamphleteers, thinking perhaps of the then fashionable
melodrama, 'The Castle Spectre,' saw Dublin Castle scared by
mysterious terrors.</p>

<p>'The letters <span class="smcap">C.O.N.G.R.E.S.S.</span>,' writes Orellana,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> 'are magic
letters, of themselves sufficient to rise an apparition before the
eyes of a guilty Minister&mdash;an apparition that will seem to
draw his curtains in the dead of night, and rouse him from
his pillow!'</p>

<p>The Congress was in fact the ghost of the Betrayed
Convention.</p>

<p>There was to be a great meeting at the Tholsel in Dublin,
on September 27, 1784, preliminary to the coming Congress.
The prompt arrival from London, on September 24, of O'Leary
and Parker, and Orde's confidential whisper that they were
to begin operations at once, lead to the belief that both
attended this meeting. Indeed, from O'Leary's prominent
attitude at the previous Convention, he is almost certain to
have taken part in the deliberations that followed it. No
mention, however, is made of O'Leary or Parker in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>Dublin prints of the day.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> The Congress and its preliminary
meeting are, no doubt, constantly referred to, but they sat
with closed doors, and no reports appear. What took place
must be gleaned from other sources. A letter from Orde,
published in Grattan's 'Life,' and dated September 18, 1784,
six days before O'Leary's arrival from London, mentions that
at the coming meeting opposition would be made to putting
a question upon the election of representatives for a National
Congress.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>As this was a period full of great issues, and yet but little
known, perhaps I may be allowed to cull from the local
journals of the day a few remarks to show the spirit which
animated both sides.</p>

<p>The 'Dublin Evening Post,' the popular organ, 'most
earnestly recommends a numerous and respectable meeting
at the Tholse on Monday next. The occasion,' it adds, 'is
great.'<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> But ere long the Castle journalist gleefully chronicles
a collapse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The weeping and gnashing of teeth among <em>the city Patriots</em> on
account of yesterday's melancholy disappointment at the Tholsel is
not to be described. What a damp must this falling off in the
metropolis give to the yet unassembled bailiwicks. Alas! alas!
that the city which laid the first stone of 'a national Congress'
should now give a shock to the precious building! How are the
mighty aggregate Committee fallen! ah, how are they despised!
Resolutions, address, circular letters&mdash;all, all are scattered to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>winds; and commotion, revolution, and scramble, sunk in an
abyss of despair beyond all hopes of resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p></div>

<p>If O'Leary attended the meeting at the Tholsel, it is easy
to know what tone he took. Three years later he published
a pamphlet in which he seems very familiar with the incidents
of that month.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I recollect the unmerited abuse given for a long time in the
papers to the Catholics, because seventeen housekeepers in Dublin
unguardedly signed a requisition to the high sheriff for the purpose
of convening an aggregate meeting relative to a parliamentary
reform, though I am confident the seventeen knew as little about
the impropriety of their signing that requisition, and foresaw as
little the offence it would give, as the high sheriff himself. And
as to the Catholics, in their disqualified situation, they could not
with either prudence or propriety follow any other line but that of
a strict neutrality in a political question, on which neither the
friends nor opponents of a parliamentary reform would acknowledge
them competent to determine.</p></div>

<p>This tamed tone will not fail to strike on comparing it
with his intrepid letter<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> written not two years before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the National Congress was announced to hold
its first meeting. 'Whatever underhand engines may endeavour
to effect,' says the popular organ, 'we hope to see
these just and constitutional deliberations re-establish the
purity of representation.'<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>One prime object of the Castle is detected and denounced
by the same courageous journalist, John Magee. The 'Dublin
Evening Post' of November 5, 1784, records:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The borough-ridden Government, disappointed in its impotent
attempts to prevent the laudable exertion of the people in prosecuting
a Parliamentary Reform, and finding that even the venal knaves
of the Castle nauseate the fulsome charges so long run on Binns
and Tandy, has directed the venal writers, as the last effort of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>expiring and despairing cause, to endeavour to sow those seeds of
dissension which so long desolated this divided Kingdom, and set
father against son, and brother against brother, that all might
become the easy slaves of foreign tyranny.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p></div>

<p>These extracts do not criminate O'Leary, but are useful
as illustrating the history of the time, and developing secret
policy, while, moreover, they correct some strange inaccuracies.
For instance: the Viceroy, writing to Sydney, as printed in
Mr. Lecky's History, calls Tandy's colleague 'Binney.' Of
course it should be Binns, a name frequently found in the
dark records of '98.</p>

<p>The Castle scribe, in another paragraph, states of Binns
and Tandy, both thoroughly honest men&mdash;'Fame is very busy
that they have received the all-subduing touch of "aurum
mirabile."' This was probably to divert suspicion from the
really subsidised quarter. It will be remembered that the
date of O'Leary's arrival, and that of Parker, quite tallies with
the meeting on the 27th September; and it may be asked
what else could have brought the popular orators to Dublin at
that juncture? Parker knew Tandy, and, as Orde remarks,
might be 'able to dive to the bottom of his secrets.'</p>

<p>While diplomacy sought to work its ends in one quarter,
brute force laboured in another to disable the arm which had
been upraised. The Sheriff of the County Dublin having
convened his bailiwick to meet on the subject of Reform, Fitzgibbon,
then Attorney-General, addressed an unconstitutional
letter to him threatening to proceed by attachment against
those who responded to his call. The sheriff himself was
fined and imprisoned.</p>

<p>The subsidised journalist, Francis Higgins, writes on
December 24, 1784:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Roman Catholics may evidently see how wickedly intent on
their ruin certain people have been, with a serious idea of extending
the elective franchise, or, indeed, any other privilege to them.
They endeavoured to cajole (the Roman Catholics) into a commotion.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p></div>

<p>In conclusion, the old charge of venality and perfidy is
brought against the incorruptible Tandy. 'Napper,' we are
told, 'betrayed them.' But Barrington, and all other historians,
admit that Tandy was sound to the core.</p>

<p>Grattan, in the Life of his father, notices as strange that
the Bishop of Derry, who the previous year was so active at
the Convention, absented himself from the Congress. The
explanation probably is that his lordship had heard something
of the detectives with a warrant for his arrest in their pocket.
How the Congress crumbled, and the organisation melted
away, a glimpse is obtained from Plowden, who embodied in
his 'Historical Review' a mass of notes made by O'Leary. 'It
is well posterity should know,' writes his biographer, 'how
much Plowden was indebted to his co-operation.'<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Plowden had never been to Ireland until about the year
1800. The following words seem those of a man who knew
the inner workings of the governmental policy in 1784.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The link of unanimity having been once severed [we read in
Plowden], the fall of the armed associations into difference and
contention was much more rapid than had been their progress to
union. The divisions of the volunteers were encouraged by Government;
and for that purpose discord and turbulence were rather
countenanced than checked in many counties, particularly upon the
delicate and important expedient of admitting the Catholics to the
elective franchise, a question which it was artfully attempted to
connect with the now declining cause of Parliamentary Reform.
Through a long series of years Government had never wanted force
to quell internal commotions; and it seemed to be now dreaded
lest an union of Irishmen should extinguish the old means of
creating dissension. The desire of disuniting the volunteers begat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>inattention to the grievances of the discontented and distressed
peasantry of the South: that wretched and lawless rabble once more
assumed the style of <em>White Boys</em>,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> and for some time committed
their depredations with impunity, particularly against Kilkenny.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p></div>

<p>The Volunteer army became gradually disorganised and
disbanded; and the cannon, on which the words 'Free Trade
or This' were inscribed, went back to the foundry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1785 things looked a little dark in Dublin, which must
have given O'Leary something to do to see through. A storm
signal was raised by a few alarmists, and the Attorney-General,
Fitzgibbon, though he sought to make light of the outlook,
admitted enough to show that the country ought to be prepared
for foul weather. Mr. Lecky, in rejecting as without foundation<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
the report confided by Rutland to Sydney in 1784, that
a French agent was then in Dublin, makes no reference to a
man named Perrin, mentioned in a remarkable speech of the
Attorney-General, Fitzgibbon, better known as Lord Clare.
On February 14, 1785, he announced in the Irish Parliament

<p>The great majority of the original Volunteers have hung up their
arms and are retired to cultivate the arts of peace: their place has
been assumed by men who disgrace the name. I have seen resolutions
inviting the French into this country. On the 26th April,
1784, the Sons of the Shamrock voted Mr. Perrin, a native of
France, honorary member of their corps. I have seen publications
inviting Catholics, contrary to the laws of the land, to arm themselves
to reform the constitution in Church and State. I have seen
encomiums on Louis XVI., the friend of mankind and the assertor of
American liberty.... They may invite the French to invade our
country. I have seen invitations to the dregs of the people to go
to drills and form into corps; we should therefore distinguish
between the gentlemen&mdash;the original Volunteers&mdash;and those sons
of sedition. I have seen a summons from a Major Canier, ordering
his corps to attend with nine rounds of ball cartridge, <em>as there might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>be occasion for actual service</em>, and at the same time intimating a
threat to Government; and will any man tell me, that we should
be overawed by such people as these? or that the Commons of
Ireland should be afraid to grant a sum of money to array a militia
until these people should lay down their arms?<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p></div>

<p>M. Perrin, the native of France, whose name Fitzgibbon
mentions in connection with the resolution to invite the French
to invade Ireland, was no doubt the father of the subsequently
well-known judge of the Queen's Bench, Louis Perrin. Under
what circumstances M. Perrin first came to Dublin is not clear.
Sometimes he was styled a Professor of French; usually
resided in Dublin; but would sojourn, for months at a time,
in the houses of such Irish gentry as wished to acquire a knowledge
of that tongue. 'Perrin's French Grammar' was at a
later date very familiar in Irish circles.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p>The tinge of disappointment which peeps forth in the
later allusion of Secretary Orde to O'Leary may have been influenced
by a circumstance casually noticed by his biographer.
We have seen from a well-informed local journal of the day,
that venal writers had received instructions to endeavour to
sow the seeds of dissension. It will be shown that O'Leary
was specially intimate with the proprietor of the Castle organ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>and O'Leary would be one of the first writers on whom Orde's
thoughts could not fail to fall. O'Leary's biographers say,
but without giving dates, that he recoiled from the proposal
to write in the organ of the Irish Government. Indeed, in a
pamphlet, previously published, he records his dislike to anonymous
compositions.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> An eloquent divine, the Rev. Morgan
d'Arcy, in preaching the funeral panegyric on Father O'Leary,
travelled slightly out of his path to touch on this point.
He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The well-timed and effectual exertions of this extraordinary
man, could not fail to attract the notice of Government, and, consequently,
were not suffered to remain unrewarded by his gracious
and beneficent sovereign; but, though he received with all becoming
gratitude this unsolicited and well-earned mark of royal remuneration,
yet such was his disinterestedness, and the noble independence
of his spirit, that when, soon after, a very considerable annuity had
been offered him to become the supporter of a periodical publication,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
which then was, and still continues to be, the foul vehicle of misrepresentation,
slander, and calumny on the Irish people; indignant
at the insulting proposal, he rejects it with becoming
contempt, though by his refusal he was sure to incur the displeasure
of a certain description of men, and through their influence
might apprehend a discontinuance of his pension; yet, destitute as
he was of all earthly property beside, sooner than prostitute his
heaven-sent talents, he leaves his native country and repairs to
this metropolis, to enjoy the boasted and enviable blessings of
British protection and British liberty.</p></div>

<p>The preacher's reference here would be to the year 1789,
when O'Leary removed permanently to London. It was in
'89 that the great struggle on the Regency Question, which will
be dealt with later on, raged between the camps of Whig and
Tory in Ireland.</p>

<p>Higgins, the subsidised owner of the Castle organ, was
called 'Shamado' by John Magee, and painted in colours of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>demoniac hue. According to Dr. Morgan d'Arcy, O'Leary did
not yield to the tempter, but rejected the proposal with indignation
and contempt, and this would naturally incur displeasure.
The statement proves too much, for Higgins, by his will dated
1791, speaks of O'Leary as his 'long and faithful friend,' and
leaves him a bequest in proof of affection. Further, his
journal devoted part of its very limited space to occasional
paragraphs laudatory of O'Leary, and not ill-calculated to
strengthen popular confidence in his name. Thus, on May 12,
1785&mdash;a few months after Orde says he had consented to
work secretly for pay&mdash;we read in the subsidised organ of the
Irish Government:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nothing can more mark the influence of wisdom and superior
genius than the mention made of Dr. O'Leary in George Anne
Bellamy's 'Apology' where she says the philanthropy and interference
of that liberal man put an end to the scandalous conduct of
Count Haslang's (the Bavarian ambassador's) chaplain on the death
of that old representative of the <i lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>The organ of the Irish Government does not praise O'Leary
for political support. To do so would arouse suspicion
whether well founded or not; but Higgins, from friendship or
policy, seeks to exalt his prestige and popularity. In the
'Freeman' of November 20, 1784, we have a long account of
how he put down Dr. Johnson, who had addressed him with
boorishness. 'The literati,' it is added, 'consider themselves
as much obliged by Dr. O'Leary's conduct on the occasion, as
it has much humbled the imperious and surly behaviour of
Johnson.'</p>

<p>The statement of Plowden, that O'Leary was pensioned
on condition that he should withhold his pen in support of
toleration,<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> will not bear test.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> In 1784, O'Leary is conclusively
shown to be subsidised. His dissuasive address to the common
people of Ireland denunciatory of Whiteboyism, a bulky
treatise, bears date 1786. It seems more likely that a subsidy
would be given for writing in support of the oppressive laws
of that day. This letter to the peasantry writes up that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>grinding impost&mdash;Tithes&mdash;in reference to which Bishop Doyle
afterwards prayed, 'May our hatred of Tithes be as lasting as
our love of justice!'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pray, my brethren, what right have you to curtail, to your own
authority, the income of the Protestant clergy? [O'Leary writes].
If the tithes became the property of the laity, they would raise their
rents in proportion. Or is it because that, from the earliest ages
of the world, those who believed in the true God have consecrated
to Him a part of the fruits of the earth, you will think it an heavier
burthen to pay the same thing because it was in conformity to the
law of God that the laws of Christian states have appointed it?
You know that the rules of justice extend to all without exception,
and that, to use the familiar phrase, everyone should have his own,
whether he be Protestant or Catholic, Turk or Christian. It is more
your interest than you imagine, that the Protestant clergy of this
country should be maintained in their rights. For many ages you
have been defenceless, destitute of any protection against the power
of your landlords, your clergy liable to transportation or death.
The mild and tolerating spirit of the clergy of the established
religion has been the only substitute for all other resources. They
trained up from their early days the Protestant nobility and gentry
in the principles of morality and virtue. If they preached against
Purgatory, they enforced charity.... If they denied that the
Pope is head of the Church, they taught their congregation that no
man is to be injured on account of his religion, and that Christianity
knows no enemy. As by nature we are prone to vice of every kind,
and that the earliest impressions are the strongest, had it not been
for those principles which they instilled into the minds of their
hearers, long before now your landed men in this country would
have treated you as Turks, who think it no scruple to violate the
beds of the Jew, and warn the husbands that if they come into
their houses whilst they are doing them this injustice they will cut
off their heads.</p>

<p>Is it then to gentlemen of this description, the children of the
first families in the kingdom, the instructors of the most powerful
part of the community, the most moral and edifying amongst them,
the most charitable and humane, that a handful of poor men are
to prescribe laws tending to diminish the support of their offspring,
destined to fill one day the most important offices in the State?
What! a Rev. Archdeacon Corker, a Rev. Archdeacon Tisdal, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Rev. Mr. Chetwood, a Rev. Mr. Weekes, a Rev. Mr. Meade, a Rev.
Mr. Kenny, who spent his time and fortune amongst you, relieving
your wants, and changing part of his house into an apothecary's
shop to supply you with medicines, which yourselves could not
purchase, must from an apprehension of violence quit his house.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p></div>

<p>In this strain O'Leary argued at much length; but the
impartial historian of this very time describes 'the system of
Tithes as the greatest practical grievance, both of the poorer
Catholics and of the Presbyterians.'<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>Most people have heard of O'Leary's controversy with
the Bishop of Cloyne, in which, when the prelate disputed
Purgatory, O'Leary retorted that he might 'go farther and
fare worse.' The 'Critical Review' examined the controversy
with a shrewdly penetrative eye. Lord Kenmare, in a letter
dated October 2, 1787, writes: 'I read with the greatest
pleasure the 'Critical Review' on the Cloyne controversy. It
is the best performance that has yet appeared on the subject.
Grattan is violent against the Bishop of Cloyne for his publication,
and thinks, with the reviewer, that Government is at
the bottom of it.'<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> O'Leary's reply, which runs to 175 pages,
contains many excellent truths worthy of commendation; but
it is a question whether this elaborate controversy may not
have been inspired and encouraged from Dublin Castle. Law
and order are, very properly, inculcated throughout by
O'Leary, and powerful dissuasives addressed to the 'Whiteboys'
are printed at the end.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> As regards the Bishop of
Cloyne, O'Leary assures him, in words somewhat supererogatory:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>'I was not sent here to sow sedition (p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>). I returned
here, not as a felon from transportation, but as an
honourable exile, who returns to his native land after having
preferred a voluntary banishment to ignorance and the abjuration
of the creed of his fathers.' Some years later, <em>i.e.</em> in
1789, he was falsely reported to have taken the latter step,
and, like Drs. Butler and Kirwan, to meditate matrimony.
'Having from my early days,' he wrote, 'accustomed myself
to get the mastery over ambition and love, the two passions
which in every age have enslaved the greatest heroes, your
correspondent may rest assured that I am not of the trio.'</p>

<p>O'Leary was a Franciscan friar who had made vows of
voluntary poverty. The fact that he had long been accustomed
to rest content with a little may help to explain the
modest sum he was satisfied to accept for services which, if
cordially rendered, were worth the amount twenty times told.
And in judging the man for accepting this money it must be
remembered that the bulk of it was spent in alms deeds.
Bishop Murphy told Father England that when a youth he was
frequently O'Leary's almoner, and that a number of reduced
persons were weekly relieved in Cork to the average extent of
two or three pounds. 'Charity,' we are told, 'covers a multitude
of sins.'</p>

assumes he could easily dive. They include Thomas Braughall, so often
mentioned in Wolfe Tone's <cite>Diary</cite> as a Catholic organiser and United
Irishman; Charles Ryan, a very important Catholic leader (fully described
in Wyse's <cite>History of the Catholic Association</cite>, i. 138-9); and Mr. Kirwan,
noticed at p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a> of the same book. Sutton, 'the Brigadier,' also mentioned in
O'Leary's letter, was, with Braughall, one of the thirty-three Catholic delegates
who, in 1793, represented the City of Dublin (see <cite>Vindication of the Catholics
of Ireland</cite>, p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>.) (London: Debrett, 1793.) Edward Lewins, the two Sweetmans,
Thomas Reynolds, and other afterwards very prominent rebels, figure in
the said list of the Dublin delegates.</p></div>

determine how O'Leary, the scene of whose labours was Ireland, could be

The accuracy of Mr. Froude's date is, however, confirmed by a letter in the

in 1782; a pension of 300<em>l.</em> a year, with a separate annuity of 200<em>l.</em> for his wife;
and, later on, the miserable post of Gentleman Usher, or Master of Ceremonies,
at Dublin Castle. It is remarkable that in all the contemporary reports of the
discreditable transaction, as regards Lord Kenmare, the name of Sir Boyle
Roche is suppressed, and George Ogle, afterwards a P.C., put in his place. Ogle

Roche we learn that 'it was usual for the members of the Irish Cabinet to
write speeches for him, which he committed to memory, and, while mastering
the substance, generally contrived to travesty into language, and ornament with
peculiar graces, of his own. On many of these occasions he was primed and
loaded for action by the industry of Mr. Edward Cooke, who acted during
several administrations as muster-master to the wisdom of the Castle.' Sir
Boyle felt that he had specially earned the gratitude of the Crown; and I find,
by the Pr√©cis book of Lord Fitzwilliam, he had even applied for a peerage. In

of Irish song, and the judge was baptised 'Louis' apparently in compliment to
the French king, described as 'the assertor of American liberty.' The bias of
the Perrins was always democratic, and the judge himself had been the attached
friend of Robert Emmet, whom he embraced in the dock. The conduct of 'P.
<em>the Scholar</em>' (T.C.D.) at this time is noticed by Archbishop Magee, then a fellow,
in a letter printed in Plunket's <cite>Life</cite>. The judge's brother, Mark Perrin,
rector of Athenry, in a letter to me, states that on the night Emmet was
sentenced to death, Louis Perrin came home to their house at Chapelizod,
bathed in tears. In that picturesque part of the 'Strawberry Beds,' where one
can cross the Liffey by a ferry, access is gained to the old churchyard of
Palmerstown, in which, partly smothered in weeds and fallen leaves, may be
traced the epitaph of Judge Perrin's father. When Brougham declared in 1828
'The Schoolmaster is abroad, and I trust to him armed with his Primer against
the Soldier in full military array,' he used the idea in a higher sense than could
apply to M. Perrin and his 'Grammar,' who, unobtrusive as he seems to have
been, caused some disquietude to Lord Clare, a man of all others the most difficult
to perturb.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_596_596" id="Footnote_596_596"></a><a href="#FNanchor_596_596"><span class="label">[596]</span></a> As service of a political or diplomatic sort might possibly be inferred from
this paragraph, I thought it just to O'Leary to see the book from which
'Shamado' quotes. The incident is described by Mrs. Bellamy in the <cite>Apology
for her Life</cite>, ii. 246-7 (Dublin ed. 1785). She complains that the remains of
Count Haslang were not treated with due respect; and that a new chaplain,
who had been assigned to the Bavarian ambassador, behaved towards 'the
chaplains and domestics of the late count with unmanly arrogance ... had it
not been for the timely arrival of that justly respected luminary Father O'Leary.'
Her account is not very clear. In what year Haslang's death occurred is not
mentioned; but the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> of the time throws in a few dates
and facts. Count Haslang died at Golden Square, London, on May 29, 1783,
after an embassy of forty-two years (liii. 454). George II. had formed an
attachment for him in Hanover, and brought him to London. Haslang's son
was Prime Minister of Bavaria, while his father, during a crisis in its history,
filled the post of ambassador to England. On June 5, 1783, a solemn dirge,
attended by all the <i lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i> in London, was sung in Warwick Street
(R.C.) Chapel; but 'owing to a dispute at the grave [in old St. Pancras] several
of the ambassadors returned home without supporting the pall.' The dispute,
which is not explained, at last obliged the Anglican chaplain to read the burial
service over the deceased envoy of a Catholic power.
</p>
<p>
O'Leary, in finally adjusting the difficulties, may have discharged a diplomatic
mission inspired from Downing Street. Mrs. Bellamy alludes to insults
offered even to the domestics of Count Haslang. How serious it was to insult
even a servant of the Bavarian ambassador is shown by the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>, xxv. 232-3. In 1755, we learn that 'T. Randall, late an officer to
the Sheriff of Middlesex, pursuant to his sentence for arresting a servant of
Count Haslang, was brought from Newgate before his Excellency's house in
Golden Square, having on his breast a paper proclaiming that he had been
adjudged by Lord Chancellor Hardwicke and the Chief Justices to be <em>a
violator of the laws of nations, and a disturber of the public repose</em>, and stands
convicted thereof.' Randall was carried back to Newgate.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bellamy, in vaguely alluding to insults offered even to Count Haslang's
domestics, doubtless includes herself, for Haslang describes her as his 'housekeeper'
(<cite>Life</cite>, ii. 104). This woman, the natural daughter of Lord Tyrawley,
ambassador at Lisbon, was introduced into society by his sister; became a very
influential person, and shared the confidence of Fox and other Whig lights.
O'Leary, she describes (ii. 8): '... who, with unaffected piety, is blest with
that innocent chearfulness which, joined to his brilliant wit and sound understanding,
makes him the admired darling of all who have the happiness of
knowing him.'
</p>
<p>
Count Haslang's house in Golden Square has been, since 1789, the presbytery
of Warwick Street R. C. Chapel; and its transfer to parochial uses dates
also from that year.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

THE REGENCY&mdash;STRUGGLE BETWEEN WHIG AND TORY
CAMPS&mdash;O'LEARY AND THE PRINCE OF WALES</h2>


<p>The State Papers throw no light on what Plowden styles
'the arbitrary withdrawal of O'Leary's pension.' The following
historic incident, now forgotten, and curious in its
detail, may have led to that act.</p>

<p>In 1789, a great struggle raged between the Parliaments
of England and Ireland on the question of creating the
Prince of Wales Regent during the insanity of George the
Third. The Prince at this time had been bound up, politically
and socially, with the Whigs. Pitt, fearing that the Regency
might prove fatal to his ambition and his Cabinet, resisted the
heir-apparent's right to the prerogative of his father, and
declared that 'the Prince had no better right to administer
the government during his father's incapacity than any other
subject of the realm.' An address to the Prince from the
Irish Parliament requested that he would 'take upon himself
the government of Ireland during the continuation of the
King's indisposition, and no longer; and under the title of
Prince Regent of Ireland, in the name, and on behalf of his
Majesty, to exercise, according to the laws and constitution
of that kingdom, all regal powers, jurisdiction, and prerogatives
to the crown and government thereof belonging.'</p>

<p>Pelham, speaking of 'the tricks and intrigues of Mr. Pitt's
faction,' adds, 'I have not time to express how strongly the
Prince is affected by the confidence and attachment of the
Irish Parliament.' Portland takes the same tone. The
Buckingham Papers afford rich material for a history of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
struggle. The noble editor admits that 'the Parliament of
Ireland preserved the unquestionable right of deciding the
Regency in their own way. The position of Lord Buckingham<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
had become peculiarly embarrassing. What course
should be taken in the event of such an address being
carried? The predicament was so strange, and involved
constitutional considerations of such importance, as to give
the most serious disquietude to the Administration.'<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>Hopes were felt that the King might recover. The
Viceroy receives instructions to use obstructive tactics, 'to
use every possible endeavour, by all means in your power,
debating every question, dividing upon every question, moving
adjournment upon adjournment, and every other mode that
can be suggested, to gain time!'<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> But the Viceroy did more.
He openly threatened to make each opponent 'the victim of
his vote.' Fitzgibbon was promised the seals and a peerage
if he succeeded for Pitt. Lures and threats were alternately
held out. The peerages of Kilmaine, Glentworth, and
Cloncurry were sold for hard cash, and the proceeds laid out
in the purchase of members. Meanwhile the King got well.
Thereupon the Master of the Rolls, the Treasurer, the Clerk
of Permits, the Postmaster-general, the Secretary of War, the
Comptroller of Stamps, and other public servants, were
dismissed. The Duke of Leinster, Lord Shannon, the Ponsonbys
were cashiered. Employments that had long remained
dormant were revived, sinecures created, salaries
increased; while such offices as the Board of Stamps and
Accounts, hitherto filled by one, became a joint concern. The
weigh-mastership of Cork was divided into three parts, the
duties of which were discharged by deputies, while the
principals, who pocketed the profits, held seats in Parliament.
In 1790, one hundred and ten placemen were members of
the House. The Viceroy, Buckingham, during his short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>r√©gime, added 13,040<em>l.</em> a year to the pension list; the names
of the recipients are already on record. On the other hand,
some men who had taken the Prince's side in the contest lost
their pensions. O'Leary may have been in this batch.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
Croly, in his 'Life of George IV,' dilates on the intimate
relations which subsisted between the Prince and the priest,
and adds that O'Leary was no unskilful medium of intercourse
between his Church and the Whigs, and contributed in no
slight degree to the popularity of the Prince in Ireland.
According to Buckley, the Prince patronised O'Leary to such
an extent that rumour whispered it was by him the marriage
ceremony with Mrs. Fitzherbert had been performed.</p>

<p>Barrington, describing the chastisement applied to those
who, in Ireland, favoured the appointment of the Prince as
Regent, says: 'Lord Buckingham vented his wrath on the
country;' but what proof have we that the alleged agent of
the Castle, O'Leary, incurred that Viceroy's displeasure?</p>

<p>In 1789, the year O'Leary removed permanently to
London, he settled down, at the Spanish Ambassador's Chapel
in London, as an assistant priest to Dr. Hussey, and, apparently,
a most unwelcome one. An extraordinary pamphlet,
not known to his biographers, was privately issued by O'Leary
referring to a feud between himself and Dr. Hussey. At
page <a href="#Page_11">11</a> O'Leary writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The old clerk told me in the vestry, 'that I might now return
to Ireland, as my enemy, the Marquis of Buckingham, had returned
to England.' Surprised how or where the clerk of a vestry could
get such an insulting information, I recollected that his master [Dr.
Hussey] had told me some time before that he had seen a letter
from the Marquis of Buckingham, when Viceroy of Ireland, to some
nobleman or gentleman of the English Catholic Committee, wherein
he depicted the Catholics of that kingdom in very unfavourable if
not odious colours, and painted me as one of the ringleaders.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>This serves to explain Dr. England's remark in 1822,
when accounting for O'Leary's permanent removal to London,
that 'his residence in Ireland had become painful;'<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> but
elsewhere in his book he assigns a different reason for the
change.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been stated [he writes] that a secret condition was annexed
to this grant, binding O'Leary to reside in England,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> and
preventing him from further interference in the political concerns
of the empire. The fact, however, is that O'Leary had made
previous arrangements for a permanent residence in London&mdash;not
only as being more favourable to his health, which generally suffered
by his visits to Dublin, but from a rational conviction that the
great seat of influence and power was the proper sphere of his
benevolent exertions.</p></div>

<p>This biographer did not know O'Leary personally; his
conjecture, or explanation, is plausible. But few men would
remove for their health to the purlieus of St. Giles and Soho,
the mission with which O'Leary had most to do. Its fearful
squalor at the period described is curiously shown in Clinch's
recently published 'Bloomsbury and St. Giles.' It will be
remembered that the preacher of his funeral sermon conveys
that the migration in 1789 was caused by O'Leary's refusal
to write in a venal Dublin print against the party with whom
he had long been associated. Snubbed by the Viceroy,
Buckingham, his usefulness at Dublin Castle was now a thing
of the past; but yet, as he could not afford to give up all State
endowment, I suspect that he settled down in London in some
undefined diplomatic r√¥le, where his tact and influence would
find a field for exercise. A most careful memoir of O'Leary,
ending with the words 'Requiescat in pace'&mdash;written probably
by his friend and co-religionist Plowden&mdash;appears in the
'Gentleman's Magazine' for February 1802. It contains some
facts not noticed by his more diffuse biographers. 'This
laudable conduct,' we are told, 'did not escape the attention of
the Irish Government, and induced them, when he quitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Ireland, to recommend him to men of power in this country.'
I believe that O'Leary's removal to London was made under
Government auspices, extended in the hope that, by his
diplomatic power, it might lead to useful knowledge and
results.</p>

<p>As George, Prince of Wales, held Whig views at this time,
Mr. Pitt's great career ran some risk of being cut short.
The Prince gathered round him the leading Whig lights, including
O'Leary, as we learn from Croly's 'Life of George IV.'<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
A good picture of life in the Pavilion at Brighton is given,
and of the brilliant jokes which capped the hits of Sheridan
and Curran. But O'Leary's presence had, I think, a deeper
significance. With graver men his intercourse was frequent.
'Edmund Burke was very marked in the regard which he
manifested to O'Leary,' writes England. 'Fox was not only
Pitt's rival, but the leader of a powerful party constantly on
the watch to oust Pitt from office.' It may be presumed that
the men of power in London to whom O'Leary, on leaving
Ireland, had letters from Dublin Castle, occupied a camp
hostile to the Whig garrison of the Pavilion.</p>

<p>One proof that O'Leary wished to regain favour with Pitt
is afforded by the casual remark of his biographer. 'When
O'Leary learned that his friend (Plowden) was engaged at the
desire of Pitt in writing the 'Historical Review,' he sent him
his invaluable collections, as affording the best and most
authentic materials for the recent history of Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>I do not like that phrase of Plowden in which he says&mdash;when
speaking of O'Leary's pension&mdash;that it was only after
giving repeated proofs that the secret condition had been
complied with, he received a large arrear.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Plowden no doubt
thinks that the pension was meant as 'hush money;' but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>is a question whether O'Leary was quite frank with him as
to its character.</p>

<p>'An oak of the forest is too old to be transplanted at fifty,'
said Grattan, regarding Flood's removal to London in 1784.
'Disgusted with the condition of his country,' writes O'Leary's
later biographer, Buckley, 'and hopeless of doing anything
by which it could be improved, he resolved on quitting it
altogether and living in the free atmosphere of England, so
congenial to a bounding and manly temperament like his....
In the year 1789 Arthur O'Leary left Ireland for ever,
and took up his residence in London as one of the chaplains
to the Spanish Embassy.'<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> It appears, however, from the
testimony of Plowden, the attached friend of O'Leary, that
it was a condition expressly made by the Crown that O'Leary
was 'to reside no more in Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> I suspect that the appointment
just described was brought about by Court intrigue.
From the time of the Armada the movements of the Spanish
minister were viewed with jealousy, often with alarm. In
1779, when the combined fleets of Spain and France rode
menacingly in the Channel, O'Leary, as we have seen, denounced
them to the Irish people, and his appointment to the Spanish
embassy must have been the work of England rather than
of Spain. In 1789 strained relations had again arisen
between Spain and England; and a few years later war was
actually declared by Spain.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Sydney states that O'Leary had
already consented to furnish secret information.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> His present
position would enable him to acquire knowledge of, not only
the designs of Spain, but of Dr. Hussey too; and without
saying that O'Leary could be capable of downright treachery,
it is probable that Pitt believed he would. It will be remembered
that, in 1780, Dr. Hussey, chief chaplain to the Spanish
embassy in London, had been sent with Richard Cumberland
to effect a treaty with the Court of Spain, a negotiation not
entirely successful. What was the precise nature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>hold which Hussey, originally a Carthusian monk, acquired
over the Court of England is destined to remain shrouded.
Buckley says it was at the special request of George III. that
Dr. Hussey accompanied Mr. Cumberland on a secret mission
to Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>What Cumberland himself thought of his colleague is
curious to see. We are told that 'the high-sounding titles
and dignities showered upon Dr. Hussey by the Court of Spain
outweighed in his balance English guineas;' that 'in his heart
he was as high a priest as √† Becket, and as stiff a Catholic
as ever kissed the cross;' but yet 'had left behind him
in his coffin at La Trappe no one passion native or ingrafted
that belonged to him when he entered it.' So clear-sighted a
man as Hussey could not fail to see the secret thoughts of
Cumberland, or to have diagnosed, in his turn, the jaundiced
retina through which he was viewed; for Cumberland complains
of 'his singular, sudden, and capricious conduct to the author
and his family, of which he was an inmate.'<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Hussey had
demanded his passports to return to England; but on Cumberland's
remonstrance paused, and cancelled a letter he had
addressed to the English Secretary of State asking leave to
return. Mystery covers much of this mission to Spain, for
Cumberland says, 'I will reveal no more than I am in honour
and strict conscience warranted to make public. For twenty
years I have been silent, making no appeals at any time but
to my official employers, who were pledged to do me justice.'<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Froude tells us that Dr. Hussey<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> was in the confidence
of Dundas and Portland, and had received favours from them.
Both were prominent statesmen in the Cabinet of Pitt, and
both eventually turned against Hussey. Dr. Hussey is described
as Chaplain to his Catholic Majesty of Spain, and
Rector of the Church of the Spanish Embassy in London.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
He evidently knew something of O'Leary not revealed to the
world.</p>

<p>At this point it may be well to open once more the pamphlet
privately printed&mdash;'A Narrative of the Misunderstanding
between the Rev. Arthur O'Leary and the Rev. Mr. Hussey.'
Its purport, O'Leary says, is to remove the bad impressions
which a late report, one which impugned his morality, might
have made on some Catholic families, and the reader is
requested either to burn the brochure, or erase altogether
the name of Mr. Hussey. The latter is just the man to have
muttered 'qui s'excuse s'accuse' as he read the following; and
O'Leary's remark serves to show that Hussey suspected he
had deeper motives.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The desire of co-operating in the work of the ministry [writes
O'Leary] was my only inducement for associating with Mr. [Hussey]
in the Spanish Ambassador's Chapel. He soon began to throw
some obstacles in my way&mdash;but in the most insulting and contemptuous
manner. The old clerk of his vestry, who retails among
the common people all the stories he hears from his employer, was
commissioned by him to direct me in the choice of my theme [in
the pulpit].<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p></div>

<p>In 1780, the Spanish ambassador to London was, we
learn, 'Count Fernan Nunez, who had committed himself to
a conversation from which Mr. Hussey drew very promising
expectations.'<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> But in 1789 we find him succeeded by no
less a person than the Marquis del Campo, whose previous
attitude, as sub-Premier of Spain, had filled the British
Cabinet with alarm.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Orde, writing to Nepean, of the Home
Office, five years before, tells him to be very watchful over
this minister; and O'Leary's friend, Plowden, whatever he
means by it, says that it was only after giving repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>proofs that the secret conditions had been complied with, that
O'Leary received a large arrear of his pension.</p>

<p>'A Narrative of the Misunderstanding' between O'Leary
and Hussey shows that the appointment of the former as
Hussey's colleague was forced upon the latter, and that
Hussey distrusted and despised him, confirming the old adage,
two of a trade never agree. O'Leary complains that on
Good Friday, in presence of a crowded congregation numbering
many Protestants, Hussey sent</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>one of the boys who attend the altar, twice into the pulpit to
interrupt me in the most pathetic part of my discourse by chucking
the sleeves of my surplice and ordering me to come down under
pretence that the ceremonies of the day were too long. Thus a
scene was exhibited of which neither the congregation nor myself
had ever been spectators before.</p></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the manner in which he concerted his plans, in waiting until
the eve of the days on which I was to appear in public, and then
sending me, on a sudden, verbal messages by his clerk, and afterwards
such insulting notes as no Prelate would send to the meanest
clergyman in his diocese, one would be apt to imagine that he
played the part of a skilful general, who amuses an enemy the
better to decoy him unprepared into an ambuscade.</p>

<p>I was surprised at such peremptory mandates from a man who,
at most, could pretend but to an equality.... But his view was,
either to disgust me with the chapel, or to commit me with the
public, in thus thwarting me in the exercise of my functions.</p></div>

<p>O'Leary was the lion of the hour; his portrait looked out
from the windows of Bond Street and Piccadilly, surrounded
by soul-stirring sentiments culled from his published books.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
There it was that Dr. Hussey sought to reduce his prestige,
which he considered overcharged, and to destroy the confidence
and respect usually manifested in his regard. It is certain
that he felt as uncomfortable in his society as he had ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>done in the hair shirt and enforced reserve of La Trappe.
He did not brand O'Leary as a spy; he could not do so without
offending the Government; but he raised what lawyers call 'a
false issue.' Indeed O'Leary charges the doctor, on strong
circumstantial evidence, with having supplied to the newspapers
paragraphs in which an unworthy innuendo is advanced,
and one by no means calculated to exalt the friar's reputation
for asceticism: 'In proportion as the breach widened between
us, the paragraphs rose in a climax to a greater degree of
asperity.'<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>Many curious things transpire in this <em>brochure</em>, and
amongst them the following: 'I got the very singular information,'
writes O'Leary, 'that some years before, in a boarding
school at Hampstead, then under his (Hussey's) direction, he
took my picture out of a frame, tore it in several pieces, and
cast it away with disdain, saying, "One would imagine he
is founder of this establishment."'<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Here again I submit
that Dr. Hussey raised a false issue, and his dislike to O'Leary,
as evidenced by this strong proceeding, must have had deeper
grounds than the paltry plea assigned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When this affair relative to the picture happened [writes
O'Leary] I was in Ireland, in the full bloom of my reputation,<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
which I would have preserved unfaded to the last moment of my
existence, had it not spread on the lips of a man to whom I cannot
apply the Italian proverb, Whatever your mouth touches, it heals:
'La vostra bocca sana quel die tocca' (p. <a href="#Page_14">14</a>).</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hussey, as already stated, was in the secrets of the
Crown. In 1784 Sydney tells Orde, rightly or wrongly, that
O'Leary had consented to furnish private information. In
1789 O'Leary, as we have seen, removed to London and settled
down in alarming proximity not only to Hussey, but to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>minister of Spain. Hussey's attachment to Spanish interests,
Cumberland states, outweighed his devotion to his English
patrons, and of course it was highly inconvenient that a man
who played fast and loose with both should be domesticated
with O'Leary. 'They are all of them designing knaves,' writes
Orde, and doubtless he and his colleagues, acting on the
coarse prejudice thus expressed, urged the arrangement on
the principle of 'set a thief to catch a thief.' The more
refined Sydney probably calculated that it would be 'diamond
cut diamond' between them.</p>

<p>The effort it must have cost so polished a person as Dr.
Hussey to pursue the course ascribed to him may be inferred
from the words of Charles Butler: 'He was a man of great
genius, of enlightened piety, with manners at once imposing
and elegant, and of enchanting conversation: he did not come
in contact with many whom he did not subdue: the highest
rank often sunk before him.' Cumberland, his companion in the
secret mission, describes him as wearing 'a smile seductive;
his address was smooth, obsequious, studiously obliging and,
at times, glowingly heightened into an impassioned show of
friendship and affection. He was quick enough,' he adds,
'in finding out the characters of men.'</p>

<p>O'Leary appealed to Bishop Douglas, and a meeting between
the parties took place at his house. The result was a
written statement, dated June 21, 1791, that Dr. Hussey never
had any crime or immoral conduct to allege against O'Leary,
and that he had left the Spanish Ambassador's chapel of his
own free will. 'Mr. O'Leary and I have come to a full explanation
upon all past misunderstandings, and are both satisfied
with the explanation,' writes Dr. Hussey. This paper was
certified by Bishops Douglas and Berington<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> and by Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>Plowden to be conformable to Dr. Hussey's verbal declaration.
The finale was worthy of an ecclesiastic who wished to avoid
disedifying the laity by unseemly wrangles. But, privately,
Dr. Hussey took means to prevent a recurrence of an incident
which greatly annoyed him. The Castlereagh Papers contain
a letter to Lord Hobart from Sir J. Cox Hippisley, in which
he mentions as having been reported to Rome, 'a very offensive
measure of Hussey's in a way so as to have produced a sort
of censure on Bishop Douglas of London.' Dr. Hussey, it is
stated, had claimed the right, as chaplain to the Spanish
mission, of nominating priests to officiate at the Spanish
chapel in London independently of Bishop Douglas.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>Frequent reference has been already made to Del Campo.
The concluding words of O'Leary's 'Narrative' go on to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I intended to complain in person or to write a severe letter
against him to the Marquis del Campo,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> than whom there are few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ambassadors<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> of a more amiable disposition, or in whose train a
chaplain would be more happy. But, expecting never to be disturbed
by Mr. [Hussey], after leaving him in the unrivalled possession of
his pulpit and controversy, I retired without the slightest murmur.
Had I even been treated with that civility to which I was entitled,
I would yet have quitted York Street. We were on the eve of a
war with Spain, and from my peculiar obligations to my own
sovereign, in case of a threatened invasion, I would have returned
to Ireland, where, upon a similar occasion, the exertions in the
line of my profession had been attended with the happiest results
in promoting that loyalty which recommends my Religion and
countrymen.</p></div>

<p>Here O'Leary, though so recently attached to the Spanish
embassy, declares himself a partisan, if not a sentinel, in the
English interest. It appears that, while officiating at Spanish
Place, he lodged in Warwick Street, probably acting as
assistant chaplain to the Bavarian embassy as well, and
where, as Mrs. Bellamy records, he arrived opportunely, in
1783, to adjust angry difficulties that had arisen in that
quarter. Seven years later, although ostensibly pastor of
St. Patrick's, Soho, from 1790 to his death, he seems still
attached in some way to the Bavarian chapel and embassy,
for the preface to his sermon in denunciation of French
principles is dated from Warwick Street, though the sermon
itself had been preached at St. Patrick's.</p>

<p>In March 1797, O'Leary's desire to retain the favour of
Pitt is traceable in the sermon to which reference has just
been made. It was preached before a congregation mainly
Irish, but embracing also the famous Duchess of Devonshire,
and many other great personages.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Its aim is apparent in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>account given of it by the 'Monthly Review' as 'a discourse
well adapted to keep alive a high degree of good, warm,
Christian hatred of the French, on whom the preacher is very
severe, with now and then a stroke of pleasantry, sarcasm and
rough wit.' Ireland had been nearly lost to England the previous
year by Hoche's expedition to Bantry Bay, but England's
unsubsidised allies, the winds, had come to her aid. O'Leary's
discourse, occupying fifty pages, was at once issued in pamphlet
shape, and reprinted in Dublin.</p>

<p>As has been already observed, O'Leary maintained cordial
relations with some men who bore a bad name. Francis
Higgins, originally a Newgate felon, became at last a most
influential negotiator. Plowden exhibits fully his unpleasant
character in the 'Historical Review,' vol. ii. pp. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>-9.
'This man' he says, 'had the address, by coarse flattery and
assumed arrogance, to worm himself into the intimacy of
several persons of rank and consequence, who demeaned themselves
by their obsequiousness to his art, or sold themselves
to him. The fact that he died worth 40,000<em>l.</em> is highly
illustrative of the system which generated, fostered, and
pampered this species of reptile.' Higgins is shown by the
'Cornwallis Papers' to have been a spy on a great scale.
There is reason to know that he wormed himself into the confidence
of O'Leary; and reason to fear that he turned it to
account. The man who began his career by duping a Jesuit
and obtaining his co-operation in making an heiress his wife,
is not likely to have failed with the genial Franciscan. Higgins
early won the friendship of O'Leary; and his bequest 'to
my long and faithful friend, the Rev. Arthur O'Leary,' has
been already noticed. Fidelity to Shamado seems like fidelity
to Mephistopheles!</p>

<p>Higgins liked to utilise profitably the information he
acquired from pliable Catholics like Magan.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> Magan was a
barrister, and held his head high. It will be remembered that
Higgins drew from him the secret of Lord Edward Fitzgerald's
hiding place, and for this service alone received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>1,000<em>l.</em> in hand, and a pension of 300<em>l.</em> a year. The 'Sham
Squire' was not the man to leave money, in 1791, 'to his long
and faithful friend,' O'Leary, unless he had made more than
the amount by the use of him. Higgins claims O'Leary as a
dear friend; the habits of the time warrant the assumption
that he was his boon companion too. In the unguarded
intimacy of social intercourse, that frank and affable nature
is likely to have enriched the Squire's stock of gossip. To
what extent that confidence was unfolded can be now but
darkly surmised.</p>

<p>O'Leary, if called upon to reveal information to the
Government, may have acted with reserve. In softer
moments<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> much may have leaked out which was not deliberate
betrayal.</p>

<p>It is casually stated by Mr. Lecky (vol. vii. p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>) that
Higgins, in enumerating his services to the Government, especially
mentions the expense he had incurred in entertaining
priests, and other persons of the higher class, for the purpose
of obtaining intelligence. In one respect O'Leary's intercourse
with Higgins worked for good. The newspaper of the latter,
though an organ of Orangeism, advocated the Catholic claims.</p>

<p>In 1796 Dr. Hussey, afterwards Bishop of Waterford, seems
to have accepted the post of secret agent,&mdash;probably not widely
dissimilar from that which the statesmen of 1784 thought
O'Leary would not object to discharge. Higgins, writing to
Dublin Castle in October 1796, expresses regret that the
Government had not been very judicious in their selection of
'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>an agent for acting on the Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> 'The Roman Catholic
body hold a superficial opinion of Dr. Hussey as a courtly
priest. If anything was to be effected or wished to be done
in the Roman Catholic body, Dr. O'Leary would do more with
them in one hour than Hussey in seven years. Of this I am
perfectly assured; and O'Leary not ten days since wrote me
word he would shortly claim a bed at my house.'</p>

<p>O'Leary had a nephew for whom in a recently published
letter he hopes to provide a berth when some friends of his
would regain their power. The allusion no doubt is to Fox and
the Whigs. This is the nephew noticed by Francis Higgins,
in a secret letter to Under-Secretary Cooke eight months before
the rebellion. 'At a meeting at Bond's, which Lord Edward
Fitzgerald and O'Connor attended, O'Connor read a letter from
Fox which had been delivered to him (O'C.) by O'Leary,
nephew of Dr. O'Leary, who had arrived from London with
despatches from Mr. Fox, and set off in the mail for Cork the
same night.' These despatches concurred with the United
Irishmen as to the necessity of enforcing a parliamentary
reform.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>The bequest of Higgins to O'Leary is noticed as strange by
the priest's biographer. Was it meant by way of restitution,
seeing that the compact to pay O'Leary had been broken?
As in the case of the betrayal of Lord Edward Fitzgerald by
Magan, 'Shamado' no doubt pocketed the lion's share.</p>

<p>The will of Francis Higgins goes on to say: 'To Andrew
D. O'Kelly, of Piccadilly, London, I leave 300<em>l.</em>: declaring
that if I did not know that he, my friend, was in great affluence,
I would have freely bequeathed him any property I
might be possessed of.' This was the man sometimes known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>as Count O'Kelly, but more generally as Colonel O'Kelly. An
Irish judge who once acted as advising counsel for the
legatees of O'Kelly, informs me that the latter was originally
a jockey, afterwards a successful blackleg, and was made
colonel of a regiment that never existed, simply by the Prince
Regent addressing him under that title. This explains a
remark made by the 'St. James's Gazette,' that 'his military
rank, whatever right he may have had to it, as well as to his
Countship, could never obtain for him an entrance to the
clubs of his fellow sportsmen.'<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> He owned the racehorse
'Eclipse,' and by its aid netted 124,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p>There has been much discussion by O'Leary's biographers
upon Plowden's statement as to the stoppage of the pension,
and they vainly try to account for so harsh a step. 'What
the reason for this withholding was, it is not easy to ascertain,'
writes Father Buckley; but, from an observation in the 'Life
of Grattan,' by his son, we surmise that it must have been
because O'Leary refused to comply with a request made by
the minister, that he <em>would write in the support of the Union</em>.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
Plowden takes care to say that the pension was 'hush money.'
Buckley's argument demands, however, a fuller reply.</p>

<p>The agitation against the Union took place chiefly in 1799.
O'Leary died in January 1802, soon after the Union became
law. Plowden, through whom he got the arrears paid, says
that it was 'after a <em>lapse of many years</em>, by importunity and
solicitation, and <em>repeated proofs</em> of his having complied with
the <em>secret conditions</em>, he received a large arrear.' Therefore
there could not have been time for all this in the interval
between the Union and O'Leary's death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in point of fact, O'Leary <em>did</em> express himself publicly
in favour of the Union. His 'Address to the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal,' dated from O'Kelly's house, and published
in June 1800, mentions that he is 'a great friend to the
Union, and reconciled many to it;' and then follows much
clever argument in support of the measure. This rather
spoils the statement in Grattan's 'Life,' quoted by the biographer
of O'Leary as proof that he spurned Pitt's proposal
to support the Union.</p>

<p>Colonel O'Kelly [writes Grattan] related that, at the period of
the Union, Mr. Pitt offered a considerable pension to O'Leary, provided
he would exert himself among his Roman Catholic countrymen,
and write in support of the Union; but every application was
in vain; O'Leary steadfastly resisted Mr. Pitt's solicitations, and,
though poor, he rejected the offers of the minister, and could not be
seduced from his allegiance to his country.</p></div>

<p>The newspapers recording O'Leary's death, in January 1802, say
that he died at his lodgings in Great Portland Street, London.
When the Union was carried, he probably got his <em>cong√©</em> from
O'Kelly. This man, of bad odour, became a Cr≈ìsus in wealth,
and eventually a sort of Brummagem Brummell, deep in the
confidence of George, Prince of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> O'Leary is found
living with O'Kelly in Mayfair, London, and some of his
pamphlets are dated from 46 Half-Moon Street, Piccadilly,
the 'Colonel's' house.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Father Buckley is puzzled 'how our
worthy friar contracted so close an intimacy with a man of
tastes and habits apparently so little congenial to his own.'<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
Perhaps O'Kelly<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> was the trustee in whose name O'Leary got
a pension on secret conditions. Plowden is the only writer
who alludes to the intervention of a trustee. He was very
intimate with O'Kelly, and witnessed his will in 1820. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Prince of Wales had already made O'Kelly the medium for
paying a secret pension of 300<em>l.</em> a year to Chifney the
jockey, in consideration of having designedly lost a race at
Epsom.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>I now come to a startling piece of evidence, calculated,
almost, to make one exclaim with Luke (xix. 22), 'Out of thy
own mouth I judge thee.' The testimony of no less a witness
than O'Leary himself claims to be heard.</p>

<p>More than sixty years after the death of O'Leary, Father
Buckley was informed in writing, by a relative of the deceased,
that O'Leary, when dying, often exclaimed, 'Alas! I have
<em>betrayed</em> my poor country.'<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> The informant's impression is
that O'Leary's remorse was due to having, at the request of
Pitt, acquiesced in the Union, notwithstanding that we have
'Colonel' O'Kelly's testimony that 'O'Leary withstood Pitt's
solicitations to support that measure.' The Catholic bishops
of Ireland cordially encouraged the Union, as the Castlereagh
Papers show&mdash;and we do not hear that Dr. Troy and his
<em>confr√®res</em> felt much remorse&mdash;although, in addition to their
support of the Union, they signed resolutions in favour of
giving to a Protestant king a veto in the appointment of
Catholic prelates.</p>

<p>But the letter of O'Leary's kinsman must not be dismissed
without quoting its context. 'Pitt,' he writes, 'promised the
emancipation of Catholics and repeal of the Penal Laws,
if he (O'Leary) would acquiesce, &amp;c. He did; and so silence
was deemed consent. Pitt obtained the Union; then resigned
his office; and tricky enough,' adds O'Leary's kinsman,
'said he could not keep his promise.'</p>

<p>This is slightly misleading. Pitt had given a pledge,
through Cornwallis, to Archbishop Troy that he would not
accept office except on condition that the Catholic claims were
to be met. In 1801, owing to the fixed resolve of the King
against Emancipation, Pitt went out. His conduct, therefore,
was so far straight. When he returned to power in 1804, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>complete violation of that compact, O'Leary had been two
years dead.</p>

<p>Among O'Leary's admirers there was none more ardent
than the late Lord Chancellor O'Hagan, in whose now deserted
study still hangs a fine portrait of the friar, inscribed with
soul-stirring sentiments on which O'Hagan had long sought
to shape his own course. This gentleman could not bring
himself to believe Mr. Froude's charge branding O'Leary as
a spy, and was unable to rest until he read with his own eyes
at the State Paper Office the original correspondence. He
returned to Dublin declaring that the imputation was but too
well founded. This view, coming from a man of judicial mind,
might be taken as conclusive; but yet, one is unwilling to see a
great reputation wrecked, without wishing to throw out a hope
or a plank by which there is a chance of saving it. This
plank is, indeed, a poor one; but, just as a sinking man will
grasp even at a straw, humanity suggests that no effort
should be left untried to keep the struggler afloat.</p>

<p>The two letters which led Lord O'Hagan to his reluctant
conclusion are now before the reader. In neither is the
Christian name of O'Leary given; but no other priest of the
name obtained contemporary notice. The most damaging
bit of evidence is Sydney's letter to Rutland announcing that
O'Leary, having been talked to by Nepean, was willing to do
what was wished for 100<em>l.</em> a year.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> These letters bear date 1784,
eighteen years before O'Leary's death. No letters of his in
any way compromising him have been found. The voluminous
papers of Pelham, the Irish Secretary, from 1795 to 1798 do
not once mention his name. 'I have certainly never seen
any reports from O'Leary to the Government,' writes Mr.
Lecky in reply to an inquiry; 'and I have quoted in my History
every passage I have come across in which he is ever mentioned.'<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
These passages are few.</p>

<p>O'Leary was a decided humourist: no one conversing with
him felt quite sure when he meant to be serious. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>'talk' that passed he may have played the diplomat. We
have seen how Orde distrusted him. To a request blandly
urged in personal converse by a statesman who had already
pensioned him, this friar, existing merely by connivance,
could not afford to assume attitudes of offended dignity. A
glimpse of his precarious position is caught from a speech of
Grattan's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the time that this very man lay under the censure of a law
which, in his own country, made him subject to transportation or
death, from religious distinctions, and at the time that a prince of
his own religion threatened this country with an invasion, this
respectable character took up his pen and, unsolicited and without
a motive but that of real patriotism, urged his own communion to
peace, and to support the law which had sentenced himself to
transportation.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p></div>

<p>Nepean and Orde suggested certain inquiries which O'Leary
was to make; but who can tell at what point of these inquiries
the practised casuist may have meant to draw the line? A
hundred pounds a year, which Nepean says he named, seems
marvellously small for the magnitude and risk of the service
expected. Orde writes on September 8, 1784, expressing
satisfaction that Nepean, in London, had 'settled matters with
O'Leary, who can get to the bottom of all secrets in which
the Catholics are concerned, and they are certainly the chief
promoters of our present disquietude.' A fortnight later,
after an interview with the priest at Dublin Castle, he adds,
(September 24, 1784): 'O'Leary has it in his power, <em>if we
can depend upon him</em>, to discover to us the real designs of the
Catholics, from which quarter, after all, the real mischief is
to spring.' O'Leary must have known that, in 1784, <em>no</em> treasonable
designs were harboured by the Catholics, and probably
felt that he would be safe in making the inquiries prescribed.
Mr. Lecky, a most patient historic investigator, a man who
has searched more secret sources of sound information than
any other writer of Irish history, while he considers that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
letters just quoted prove O'Leary a spy (p. <a href="#Page_369">369</a>), yet, in describing
this very time, doubts</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>whether the Catholics themselves took any considerable part in
these agitations. For a long period an almost death-like torpor
hung over the body, and, though they formed the great majority of
the Irish people, they hardly counted even in movements of opinion.
Even when they were enrolled in volunteer corps there were no
traces of Catholic leaders. There was, it is true, still a Catholic
Committee which watched over Catholic interests; Lord Kenmare
and a few other leading Catholics were in frequent communication
with the Government; two or three Catholic bishops at this time
did good service in repressing Whiteboyism; and Dr. Troy, who
was then Bishop of Ossory, received the warm thanks of the Lord-Lieutenant;<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
but for the most part the Catholics stood wholly apart
from political agitation.</p></div>

<p>I do not like repetitions; but they are sometimes a necessity,
as in judicial summing-up. Twelve days after O'Leary
had been set to work, the Chief Secretary at Dublin Castle
seems quite dissatisfied with him. The tone in which our
humourist's reports were pitched may be guessed from the
following passage in a later pamphlet from his pen<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield, on his return from his Viceroyship, informed
George II. that he had met in Ireland but <em>two dangerous Papists</em>,
of whom <em>His Majesty should be aware</em>&mdash;two [comely] ladies named
Devereux, who had danced at the Castle on the King's birth-night.
All the viceroys of Ireland, from Lord Chesterfield to Earl Camden,
could have made a much similar answer, if interrogated, concerning
what is called the <em>danger of Popery</em>.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether from this tone, or from other causes, the Government
became quite disappointed with their man; for, as
Plowden states, they withheld his pension, and 'an arbitrary refusal
for many years threw the reverend pensioner on his friends
for subsistence.' 'The unexplained cause,' noticed by Dr.
England,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> may, perhaps, here be guessed. O'Leary, as Sydney
states, consented, in 1784, to make the secret inquiries which
Orde wished, and probably to offer such advice as his experience
should suggest; but the idea thrown out at an early stage of
this study seems likely enough,&mdash;that, after he had made due
efforts to find out the truth, he pleasantly assured the Government
that no French emissaries had been to Dublin at all;
that the Catholics were loyal subjects; and, instead of a
slumbering volcano, that Rutland had found a mare's nest!
This Viceroy's letter will be remembered in which he drew a
highly sensational picture of alleged secret doings in Dublin.
It was he who first urged on Sydney the wisdom of securing
O'Leary as a spy, and Sydney soon after reports the negotiation
as successful. But we have no testimony from Nepean with
whom the interview took place. When Rutland spoke, Orde
spoke; the act of one was the act of the other. Both were
equally fluent as correspondents; but during the three subsequent
years that they held office at Dublin Castle, we find
no letters from either announcing any discoveries made by
O'Leary, and which, no doubt, they would have been only too
glad to do as confirming their own forecast, and building up
a reputation for subtle statesmanship.</p>

<p>More troublesome times came within the next ten years:
the Society of United Irishmen spread with alarming rapidity;
and if O'Leary had any wish to play the spy, he had now
a grand opportunity by simulating ardent patriotism like
McNally and others. His great sermon in 1797 was a declaration
of war against French principles, and against all
who adopted the policy of revolution. Again, when it became
necessary for him to preach the panegyric of Pius VI., who
died at this time, he went out of his way to run full tilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
against democracy. The 'Courier,' a popular organ, thus
describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Abounding with glowing imagery, classical allusion, and displaying
in every sentence the energy of an enlightened and vigorous mind,
the Doctor took occasion to felicitate his flock, in the most emphatic
terms, on the happiness enjoyed in this country, on the constitution
and state of which he pronounced a fine panegyric, happily applying
to the extent of our dominion and national glory the line of the
poet&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Imperium Oceano, famamque terminat astris.
</p>
</div>

<p>O'Leary's friends will hope that it was by this tone, rather
than by playing the ignominious <em>r√¥le</em> of a spy, that he sought
to regain governmental favour.</p>

<p>The sole remaining letter in the carefully preserved records
of the informers of '98 which names O'Leary must not be
excluded here. Things had quite changed since 1784.
Higgins, in a secret letter to Dublin Castle, dated January 2,
1798, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I took leave to inform you, some time since, that many Roman
Catholics seem apparently sorry for the lengths they've been led,
and suggested, if O'Leary, or any popular preacher, was to exert
himself among them, thousands would come to swear allegiance.
I know O'Leary would be a tower of strength among them. He
was their first champion, and is most highly respected by the multitude.
His writings and preaching prevented the White Boys
and insurgents of the South from joining the rabble of Cork and
rising <i lang="fr">en masse</i> at the period when the combined fleets of Spain,
France, etc., were in the English Channel.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p></div>

<p>Higgins does not say that O'Leary authorised him to make
this proposition; and even had he done so, it cannot be
deemed base.</p>

<p>Orde's letters to the Home Office in 1784, though urging
extreme caution lest he and his colleagues should be themselves
betrayed, show him to be impulsive in statement, and prone
to jump to conclusions. These letters, blemished by an
occasional expletive, are printed by Mr. Lecky. Orde is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
sanguine as regards wonderful Catholic secrets that O'Leary
would unearth, but this is not the only case in which he
exhibits rashness of assumption.</p>

<p>These notes must now end. If their freedom and fulness
need justification, it is found, perhaps, in O'Leary's own words.
He had meditated a history of the political events of 1780.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The duty of the Historian [he writes] binds him to arraign at
the impartial tribunal of truth both men and actions; unmask the
leading characters; examine into their motives; lay open the hidden
springs of proceedings, whether worthy of applause, or deserving
to be doomed to censure; and embellish his narrative with
suitable reflections. No person is obliged to write a history [he
adds], but when he writes it he must tell the truth.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p></div>

<p>A word remains to be said respecting Parker, the second
agent named in Orde's letter of 1784. He is not so easily
identified as Father O'Leary. The Irish books which treat of
the period may be vainly searched for the name of Parker.
It has been said that the adventurous spirit, who thirteen
years later aroused by his eloquence the British navy to
mutiny, was identical or connected with Orde's agent. I do
not bind myself to the truth of this theory; nor am I able to
prove a negative; but certainly some circumstances support
it worthy of consideration; and having promised in a former
chapter to recur to Parker of the Nore, I am afforded an
opportunity for doing so by Mr. Froude's account of the secret
mission to Dublin. Orde's agent arrived there in September
1784, to overreach and, as we are told, outmouth noisy
patriots. It is true that Parker the mutineer was finally
executed by the English authorities; but Jemmy O'Brien,
the spy, also swung at the same hands. The former had
received a classical education, and had served in the navy
during the American War. His character was bad. His
irrepressible oratory and power of influencing minds got
him into scrapes. He married a woman with some property,
which he dissipated, and was then imprisoned for debt.
Released at length, he was sent on board the royal fleet as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>'supernumerary seaman,' to quote Portland's proclamation
offering 500<em>l.</em> for his arrest. 'The address, ready eloquence,
but, above all,' says Rose, 'the deep dissimulation he possessed,
gave him vast influence over his comrades.' If true
that Parker was sent on board the fleet to counteract mutiny,
the result only shows that it is possible for an extinguisher
to take fire. In his written defence, read on the fourth day
of his trial, he 'solemnly declared that his only object of
entering into the mutiny was that of checking a most dangerous
spirit of revolt which had prevailed in the different ships,
the bad effects of which he had done all in his power to
prevent.' How he fanned the flame of mutiny, and on its
outburst was appointed 'President,' we have already seen.
This was in 1797. Who is the Parker, with persuasive oratorical
powers, that is sent on a questionable mission to Ireland
in 1784? It may be said that this cannot be Parker who
afterwards figured at the Nore, because at the time of the
secret mission to Dublin he was serving in the navy at a
far distant place. The following words of Gorton make it
hard to prove an 'alibi' for Richard Parker.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> After describing
his service during the American War, Gorton writes: 'On
peace taking place he retired from his professional duties.'
American independence had been won in 1778; but the
articles of peace were not signed by England until November
30, 1782. Therefore Parker could be easily in Dublin in
1784. Mr. Froude's remarks about him are meagre, but it
may be gleaned that the Parker of '84 was a man qualified
and ready to keep a dark diary of what he observed. Parker
of the Nore had the same habit. When he was searched, an
elaborate diary of the proceedings which had taken place on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>shipboard was found. Parker's wife testified to the fact that
he was rhapsodical and eccentric, but the plea failed to save
his life. Orde, in announcing the arrival of Parker of '84,
speaks of his 'rhapsodies,' and avows a misgiving that he
might not act discreetly. The written defence of Parker of
the Nore was highly rhapsodical, and the reverse of discreet.
But he had abundant talent. Parker of '84 is described as
an accomplished orator, and a good hand at sedition. So
was Richard Parker. The former was an expert in dissimulation.
The same character is given of Richard Parker by
Rose. It may be also noteworthy that Orde's agent hailed
from London. Mr. Froude assumes that Parker was an Irishman;
the name is certainly English.</p>

<p>The 'Courier' of October 14, 1797, records some conversations
with Richard Parker which afford a sample of the rhapsodical
eloquence which had so often entranced his audience.
An officer on board the ship that held him prisoner expressed
impatience at not getting ahead, as the winds were contrary.
'What!' said Parker, 'are you not satisfied with having
an admiral of the British fleet in chains, but you must
also usurp the command of the elements? Or, because you
have the honour to be my executioner, are you likewise
as mad as the Persian tyrant who ordered his minions to
lash the waves?' Much more of his talk is given. The
'Courier' states that 'from peculiar energy of intellect,
his diction, even in common conversation, was bold and
original.'</p>

was, clearly, because a schism threatened the diocese in consequence of the
Pope appointing Dr. Douglas bishop in opposition to the strenuous efforts made
by the Catholic Committee to get Dr. Berington translated to London. Several
lay members of that league went so far as to maintain that the clergy and laity
ought to choose their own bishops without any reference to Rome, and procure
their consecration at the hands of any other lawful bishop. After the appointment
of Dr. Douglas, they even threatened to pronounce it 'obnoxious and improper.'
Dr. Berington, however, addressed a printed letter to the London
clergy, resigning all pretension to the London vicariate, and soon the schismatical
opposition to Dr. Douglas was withdrawn. See Brady's <cite>Catholic
Hierarchy in England</cite>, pp. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>-9. (Rome, 1877.)</p></div>

Spain, I found it very much as it was in the days of Father O'Leary. A study
of Dr. Hussey's face, by Gainsborough, is preserved here, as well as some maps
and papers in the autograph of the former. The foundation stone of a new
church to replace it, and near the old one, was laid by Cardinal Manning, on
June 27, 1887, in presence of the Infanta of Spain and the Spanish minister.
Canon Barry, the present pastor, mentions an interesting tradition connected
with Tyburn tree, which, as is well known, stood near the Marble Arch: 'The
Chapel of the Spanish Embassy was, during the dark days of persecution,
a special home for Catholics. Many a martyr on his way to Tyburn received
the blessing of the chaplain of the embassy and was aided by the prayers
offered in the Spanish Chapel for perseverance in his conflict for the faith.'
The Canon, in the course of a statistical detail, adds: 'When war between
England and Spain broke out, the usual payments made by Spain for the
support of the chapel fell 4,000<em>l.</em> into arrears. Diplomatic relations having
been again suspended between England and Spain in 1805, the chapel was
confided to the care of Don Miguel de la Torre.'</p></div>

Spanish diplomatic circles at this time is traceable in a despatch of Talleyrand
published last year (1890) by M. Pallain. Talleyrand states, on the authority
of the personal assurance of the Spanish minister, that nearly all the sailors
who man the British fleet are Irish, and from love of country would turn their
guns on England. The accurate number will be found set forth at p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>, <i lang="la">ante</i>.</p></div>

following letter. It notices a weakness, of which a paid purveyor of news, like
Higgins, would be apt to take ready advantage. Shamado is likely to have
been the more successful because his own character of a brain-sucker and
betrayer had not then been unmasked. On December 7, 1869, Father Buckley
writes from SS. Peter and Paul's, Cork: 'The <cite>Personal Memoirs</cite> have arrived,
and I am much pleased with them. The sketch of O'Leary I am sorry I had
not seen, to embody in my book. I fear, however, it would not have tended
much to enhance the esteem of the good <em>padre's</em> character, inasmuch as, in the
background of the picture, there is a strong steam of whisky-punch, and the
narrative affords a strong confirmation of what Michael Kelly records that
Father O'Leary, like himself, was rather partial to "Saint Patrick's Eye-Water."</p></div>

Hussey announces to Edmund Burke that the Catholics were loyal and ready
to spill their blood to resist the French (Lecky, vii. 90). Mr. Lecky states that
he was 'constantly employed by the Government in negotiations with the Irish
Catholics.' In September 1794, Dr. Hussey, then an <em>employ√©</em> of the Crown,
comes over to consult with the Catholic bishops at Dublin on new measures of
education (Lecky, vii. 121). The foundation of Maynooth College was the
result.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

BISHOP HUSSEY</h2>


<p>The subsequent career of Dr. Hussey&mdash;of whom a glimpse is
obtained on a previous page&mdash;affords features sufficiently
curious to claim a fuller view.</p>

<p>A second mission of secrecy to Spain proved more successful
than his first. In 1786 London swarmed with freed
negroes, made wicked by idleness, and four hundred of them,
with sixty white women in bad health and worse repute, were
shipped by the Government to Sierra Leone to form a colony.
Eight years afterwards this settlement was attacked by the
French; Spain sided against England; Dr. Hussey again
repaired to Madrid, healed the rupture, and Sierra Leone is
now a bishopric. For these and other services Hussey
enjoyed a pension from Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>The 'Wickham Papers'&mdash;published in 1870&mdash;reveal the
successful efforts of Pitt to sap Napoleon's power, by paying
Pichegru and other French generals on condition that they
would do their best to be beaten in battle. Wickham had
been sent on more than one secret mission to the Continent,
and acquired a shrewd knowledge of the intrigues of men.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
He was afterwards appointed Under-Secretary at the Home
Office, in which capacity he addressed to Lord Castlereagh at
Dublin Castle, many letters in 1798, but hundreds of their
allusions as printed have been, hitherto, unintelligible. One,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>referring to the statement drawn up by Arthur O'Connor and
the other State prisoners, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I observe also that they have passed very lightly over their
connections with the Spanish Government, and yet we have undoubted
proof that a direct communication had taken place with
some Minister of that country at the time that McNevin was at
Hamburg. The Duke of Portland particularly wishes that some of
them should be closely questioned as to this point, and the mode
now adopted of examining them separately seems to be particularly
favourable for drawing the real secret from them. They certainly
had audiences of the Spanish Charg√© d'Affaires at Hamburg, and,
I believe, also of Mr. D. C. at Paris. I have always had strong
suspicions that Dr. H.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> has sent returns of the state and temper of
the Catholics in Ireland to the Spanish Government.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p></div>

<p>'D.C.' must be Del Campo,<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> the Spanish Minister already
mentioned in Sydney's letter about O'Leary; and 'Dr. H.'
can only mean Dr. Hussey, chaplain to the Spanish embassy
in London. As such, he was the servant of Spain, and when
a conclave of English Catholics named him as envoy to Rome,
there to lay before Pius VI. a document of much importance,
Del Campo refused him leave of absence. The latter had now
ceased to be Spanish minister, and Lord Camden had become
the Viceroy of Ireland. Mr. Froude, with warmth, writes:
'Lord Camden had brought into Ireland, as he supposed,
a serpent of healing, but it turned on him and stung him.'<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
This allusion is to Dr. Hussey who, in 1797, became Bishop
of Waterford, and at once issued a pastoral charge so ultramontane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>that it gave quite a shock at Whitehall. He lived
in a style of brilliant pretension hitherto unattempted by his
brother bishops,&mdash;men who, as Shiel states, were wont to pick
their steps stealthily, as among penal traps. Dr. Hussey's
elevation to the See of Waterford was due to the British
Crown, but may have been influenced by a desire to shelve
him in a remote place where he could do scant harm by
intrigue.</p>

<p>'It was as mischievous a performance as ever I read,' quoth
Sir John Coxe Hippesley <i lang="fr">√† propos</i> of Dr. Hussey's pastoral,
'and ministers here took care he should know their sentiments
on that subject. He was in dudgeon thereat, and the Duke
of Portland told me he demanded his passport "to return to
Spain;" it was made out, but the doctor thought better of it,
and he remains to lend his hand to <em>the tranquillity</em> of Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>It appears, however, from the Vatican archives that
Hussey, in March 1798, did petition the Pope for leave of
absence from his diocese, and for a coadjutor, 'as he could not
obtain the consent of the Court of Spain to leave its service.'
He adds that for thirty years he was head of the Spanish
Ambassador's Chapel, London.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> His <i lang="fr">amour propre</i>, no doubt,
revolted from accepting at Portland's hands the passport to
return to Spain&mdash;if, indeed, he could desert his diocese without
leave from the Pope. A coadjutor bishop was not granted,
but, in reply to the request for leave of absence, it was stipulated
by Rome that Hussey should appoint efficient vicars to
govern the see while away.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Was it of this arrangement that,
as Hippesley says, he 'thought better'? Between the two
accounts the diplomat stands confessed. He certainly passed
the year 1799 in London, where, true to his instincts, we find
him busy as a bee. Writing to J. Bernard Clinch, the influential
occupant of a chair at Maynooth, he says of the then
mooted Legislative Union:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whatever my reason may tell me upon a cool inquiry, my</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>feelings rejoice at it. I told the Chancellor of your Exchequer
here, that I would prefer a Union with the Beys and Mamelukes of
Egypt to that of being under the iron rod of the Mamelukes of
Ireland; but, alas! I fear that a Union will not remedy the ills
of poor Erin. The remnants of old oppression and new opinions
that lead to anarchy (to use the words of a foolish milk-and-water
letter) still keep the field of battle, and until one side be defeated,
the country is not safe. Another project upon which I have been
consulted is, to grant salaries or pension to the Catholic clergy of
the higher and lower order.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The conditions upon which they are
to be granted, as first proposed to me, are directly hostile to the
interests of religion, and, taken in the most favourable point of
view, must be detrimental to the Catholics, by cutting asunder the
slender remaining ties between the pastor and his flock, by turning
the discipline and laws of the Church into a mercantile, political
speculation, and must end in making the people unbelievers, and,
consequently, Jacobins&mdash;upon the French scale. Whether the
prelates of Ireland have courage or energy enough to oppose any
such project so hurtful to religion, I will not say. Indeed, the
infernal Popery laws have lessened the courage of the clergy, as
well as destroyed the honesty and morals of the people, and my
affection for my native land is not so effaced as to enable me to say
with our countryman, after he had gone to bed, 'Arrah, let the
house burn away; what do I care, who am only a lodger?'<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Hussey had been so long condemned to observe the
Carthusian rule of silence that he seemed, when freed from
restraint, like an opened flask of 'Mumm.'</p>

<p>It has been said that only in the confessional, or in
chaunting, is this Trappist vow wholly dispensed with. The
desire for shrift is implied by pointing to the mouth and
beating the breast. To a man orally gifted like Hussey this
restraint must, indeed, have proved painful, and accounts for
the wonderful reaction in which he now revelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>As a preacher, he made a sensation in the West End
second only to that subsequently awakened by Irving's sermons
at Hatton Garden. Charles Butler was present at one preached
by Dr. Hussey on the small number of the elect. He asked
whether, if the arch of Heaven were to open and the Son of
Man, bursting from the mercy in which He is now enveloped,
should stand in that church and judge his hearers, 'it were
certain that three or even two&mdash;nay, trembling for myself as
well as for you, is it quite certain that even one of us,' thundered
Dr. Hussey, 'would be saved?' 'During this apostrophe,'
writes Butler, 'the audience was agonised&mdash;at the
interrogation there was a general shriek&mdash;some fell on the
ground&mdash;the greatest triumph of eloquence I ever witnessed.'<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>'Dr. Hussey was no favourite at Rome&mdash;possibly through
lay intrigue, to which Gonsalvi was but too open,' observes
an octogenarian priest of Waterford. The Holy See, however,
quite recognised Hussey's powers as a diplomatist, for
one of his last acts was to draw up the <em>Concordat</em> between
Pius VII. and Napoleon&mdash;in which delicate mission he
obtained the thanks of both. A long account of Hussey's
interview at the Tuileries is given by England; and how struck
Napoleon was with his arguments and expression.</p>

<p>The 'Burke Correspondence' describes Dr. Hussey's resolute
attitude in requiring that the rights of Catholic soldiers should
be recognised. The 'O'Renehan Papers' supply further details.
At Clonmel Gaol he demanded the release of a Catholic soldier
who had refused to receive religious instruction from the
parson. The officer in command insulted Dr. Hussey, adding
that he would flog him but for his coat. 'You wear the coat
of a brave man,' said the bishop, 'and no one but a coward
ever uttered such a threat; I dare you to touch me.' 'You
shall not remain here, sir,' cried the officer, sulkily. 'Nor the
soldier either,' replied Hussey, 'for I shall report your conduct
this day, and obtain his release.' He did write to the Duke
of Portland, and the soldier was discharged from prison.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>People were puzzled as to how Hussey managed, in penal
days, to have influence with the Home Secretary. The most
secret doings of the executive were known to Hussey. Lord
Cloncurry mentions in his 'Memoirs' (p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>), that all his
motions in London in 1798 were carefully watched by a spy,
and he adds: 'My kind informant was Dr. Hussey, who
had been private secretary to the Duke of Portland.'</p>

<p>How he first came in touch with the King's ministers, and
even with the King himself, happened in this way. When
Spain joined France in assisting America to throw off the
English yoke, the Spanish minister quitted London, giving to
Hussey authority to complete certain diplomatic negotiations.</p>

<p>Some erroneous impressions prevailed to the prejudice of
this singular man. Cumberland blows hot and cold: speaks
of the honours Hussey received from Spain, and that he had
clearly no repugnance to those that his Church could give.
'He had no wish to stir up insurrection; but'&mdash;adds
Cumberland&mdash;'to head a revolution that should overturn the
Church established, and enthrone himself primate in Armagh,
would have been his glory and felicity&mdash;and, in truth, he was
a man, by talents, nerve, ambition, and intrepidity, fitted for
the boldest enterprise.' This impression seems partly due to
a Good Friday sermon, in which Dr. Hussey announced the
speedy emancipation of the Catholics, and the downfall of
sectarianism in Ireland. He established new schools, hospitals,
and convents in Waterford, and endowed them with gold.</p>

<p>The widespread feeling of distrust in public men which
certain incidents of the time aroused is curiously shown by
the remark of Sylvanus Urban, when announcing Hussey's
death. 'The enemies of administration said he was employed
by Government to sow the seeds of dissension with a view to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>bring about the Union. Others considered him an agent of
France.'<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> We have seen, on the authority of Froude, that he
turned on his former friends in the Cabinet, and stung them;
while Edmund Burke, writing to Hussey on his famous
pastoral, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the moment that the Government, who employed you,
betrayed you, they determined at the same time to destroy you.
They are not a people to stop short in their course. You have
come to an open issue with them. On your part, what you have
done has been perfectly agreeable to your duty as a Catholic bishop
and a man of honour and spirit.</p></div>

<p>This was almost the last letter written by Burke.</p>

<p>The Pelham MSS. contain the following curious letter
addressed by Hussey to Pelham, afterwards Lord Chichester,
and a most influential member of the Government. Hussey's
informant was, no doubt, Edmund Burke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Waterford: April 19, 1797.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I received this day a letter from a friend of mine who sits
in Parliament, who heard you defend the meaning of some sentiments
in a pastoral letter, supposed to be addressed to the Roman
Catholic clergy of this diocese by the Right Reverend Dr. Hussey,
against the admixture of fulsome flattery and captious malevolence
of a placeman, and though the intimacy that once subsisted between
us has ceased, I will not be inferior in generosity to any man, and
accordingly I embrace this occasion to thank you for the justice
you do me. If done some months ago it would silence some malevolent
whispers and have obliged your humble servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thos. Hussey</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>An account of Maynooth College by one of its professors
appears in the 'Irish Magazine' for February 1808; and it
is mentioned as a fact not generally known that Burke was
'attended spiritually in his last illness by Dr. Hussey.' In
the accounts of Burke's funeral Dr. Hussey's presence is
recorded; and it is told by Dr. England that when Hussey
approached his old friend Portland in the graveyard, the
duke turned abruptly away. 'Crosses' continued to come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Pelham, replying to Dr. Duigenan on February 22, 1799,
declared that the Board of Maynooth had displaced their
president for non-residence.</p>

<p>Hussey with all his friendship for Burke was no friend to
his son. A letter from John Keogh to Hussey, dated October 2,
1792, and seemingly communicated by the latter to Dundas,
then Home Secretary, is preserved among the Secret Irish
State Papers in London. It repudiates Burke's son who had
been sent to Ireland by his father as an agent on behalf of
the Catholics, and tells Dundas that he was wholly unauthorised
to speak for that body. According to Tone's
journal of September 1792, Keogh regarded young Burke as a
spy sent by Dundas. He was wrong, for Hobart, writing to
Nepean, on October 4, 1792, states that Dundas took credit
with Westmoreland for having given Burke a chilling reception
on his return to England. This was the youth of whom
Buckle says, 'Never can there be forgotten those touching
allusions to the death of that only son, who was the joy of
his soul and the pride of his heart, and to whom he fondly
hoped to bequeath the inheritance of his imperishable fame.'</p>

<p>Hussey was succeeded as an intermediary between the
Irish Catholics and the Crown by Dr. Moylan, Bishop of Cork.
This prelate&mdash;who had denounced the French when their fleet
lay in Bantry Bay, for which he would have lost his head had
they been able to land&mdash;became a great favourite with Pitt
and Portland.</p>

<p>The duke in a letter dated Bulstrode, July 27, 1800,
states:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There can be, and there never has been, but one opinion of the
firmness, the steadiness, and the manliness of Dr. Moylan's character,
which it was agreed by all those who had the pleasure of
meeting him here, was as engaging as his person, which avows and
bespeaks as much goodwill as can be well imagined in a human
countenance.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hussey, as the first President of Maynooth, regarded
it with paternal anxiety; and as he was now in deep disfavour
with the Government, he asked Dr. Moylan to plead for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and probably draughted the words. The lay seminary of
Maynooth, in which Judge Corballis and other able men
received their education, was threatened with suppression at
this time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whoever was the adviser of this measure [writes Dr. Moylan]
consulted more his bigotry than the welfare of his Excellency's
administration, or the dictates of sound policy, for what could be
more impolitic than the suppression of the only house for the lay
education of the Roman Catholic youth immediately under the eye
and inspection of Government, and under the direction of trustees
who must have the confidence of Government&mdash;an establishment in
which the principles of loyalty and attachment to his Majesty's
Government and to our excellent Constitution are, I am bold to
say, as strongly inculcated into the minds of the pupils as in any
college or other place of education in his Majesty's dominions.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Moylan adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So violent an act gives cause to suspect that it is only a prelude
to other unfriendly measures, and in particular to the suppression
of the college at Maynooth, of which we shall ever remember with
gratitude that your Lordship has been the comer-stone.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p></div>

<p>Pelham usually endorses his letters with a memorandum
of his reply&mdash;but in this instance none seems to have been
given. Dr. Hussey regarded uneasily the threatened downfall
of the house which he had raised. The estrangement of old
friends, and prolonged anxiety, preyed upon him, and in the
following year he dropped down dead. This event occurred
at Tramore, near Waterford. He had</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fondly hoped&mdash;his long vexations past&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here to return, and die at home at last.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The Bishop outlived O'Leary by eighteen months, and
attended the funeral of his rival. His own was marked by a
painful incident. Polemic and party spirit ran so high that
some militia and soldiers attempted to throw the coffin into
the river Suir; a disgraceful riot took place, and several lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
were lost.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> My correspondent was puzzled to account for an
occurrence so painful, but it is clearly traceable to the
friction which had arisen between Dr. Hussey and certain
military officers. He was fortunate in not living to see the
extinction of the Lay College at Maynooth which had known
his fostering care.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

PRESBYTERIAN MINISTERS DEEP IN TREASON&mdash;PLOT
AND COUNTER-PLOT</h2>


<p>Twelve Presbyterian clergymen were concerned in the
rebellion: the Rev. W. Steel Dickson, D.D., who wrote an
interesting 'Narrative' of his 'Confinement and Exile,' Rev.
Samuel Barbar, Rev. William Porter, Rev. Sinclair Kelburne,
Rev. Arthur McMahon, and the Rev. Messrs. Stevelly, Simpson,
MacNeil, Sinclair, Glardy, Birch, and Warwick. Of these
men three were executed: Porter, Stevelly, and Warwick. It
is to be feared that one of the twelve became a Judas.</p>

<p>There are two informers, McMahon and Durnin, who have
never been noticed by Madden or other historians of the time.
I now quote from Bourrienne, formerly the private secretary
of Napoleon, and afterwards ambassador to Hamburg. Berthier
will be remembered as the Minister of War and Prince of
Wagram, who met a violent death during the Hundred Days.</p>

<p>'Previous to my arrival in Hamburg in 1804,' writes
Bourrienne, Marshal 'Berthier had recommended to Bernadotte
two Irishmen as spies. Bernadotte employed them, but I
learned that McMahon, one of the two, rendered himself more
serviceable to England than to us. I communicated this
fact to Bernadotte, who ascertained that my information was
accurate.' The future King replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have the honor to inform you, Marshal, that two Irishmen
residing in Hamburg, MM. Durnin and MacMahon, who had been
liberally rewarded by the English Government <em>for coming to
France</em> to act as spies on the Irish refugees and the views of the
French Government, have offered their services to assist the designs
of France in the cause of the United Irishmen.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
<p>His Majesty wishes that you should accept the offer of these
two Irishmen; that you should employ them in obtaining all
possible information, and even furnish them with whatever money
may be necessary.</p>

<p>For the sake of expedition, I have written on this subject to
General Dessolle, who commands in Hanover during your absence,
and I beg that you will transmit to him the orders necessary for
following the Emperor's instructions.</p>

<p class="right">
I have the honor, etc.<br />
<span class="smcap">Berthier.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Bourrienne says that, but for the information he had
transmitted to Berthier, Bernadotte would have conceived
himself bound to employ the two men recommended to him.
The following was his answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have received your letter, my dear minister, and thank you
for your attention in communicating to me the information it
contains.</p>

<p>I never had great confidence in the fidelity or intelligence of
MacMahon. He was never entrusted with any business of importance,
and if I furnished him with the means of subsistence, it was
because he was recommended to me by the war minister, and,
besides, his unfortunate condition could not but excite pity. I at
first allowed him four hundred francs per month; but finding him
perfectly useless, I reduced that allowance to two hundred and fifty,
which was barely sufficient for him to live on. He has not been at
headquarters for the last three months.</p>

<p>I enclose a copy of the letter which the war minister wrote to
me respecting MacMahon.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">T. Bernadotte.</span><a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p></div>

<p>Bernadotte's missive, like a shell, bursts with crushing
force. The fact that McMahon's movements in '98 are
continually reported to the British Government would show,
however, that it was not until <em>after</em> the collapse of the rebellion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and want stared him in the face, that he sold his information.
When hunger sent its spasm remorse lost its pang.</p>

<p>In the report of the Secret Committee of the House of
Lords, issued in 1798, it appears, from the sworn testimony
of John Hughes of Belfast, that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>in June 1797 he attended a meeting at Randalstown, which consisted
of Teeling, Lowry, Robert Moore, and Colonel James
Plunkett. He attended said meeting by the direction of Lowry
and Teeling to hear the report of the Colonels of the County of
Antrim. The Report was brought by Dunne, accompanied by the
Rev. Arthur MacMahon of Holywood. The first resolution was
that it would be imprudent to act at that time without foreign aid,
but that if the County of Down would act, a part of the Antrim
Colonels, who could bring out nine or ten thousand men, would act
with Down. The meeting broke up in consequence of the division
amongst the Antrim Colonels. The Rev. Arthur MacMahon told
the meeting that he had been sent by the Colonels of the County of
Down to state to the Colonels of the County of Antrim, who had
met at Park Gate that day, that they (the Colonels of Down) were
willing to rise, and that he had delivered such the message of the
Down Colonels to the Antrim Colonels. MacMahon was then a
member of the Ulster Provincial Committee, and he told him that
he had been one of the seven Colonels of the County of Down who
had been selected and appointed leaders for said county; and he
also told him that he (MacMahon) was a member of the National
Executive.</p>

<p>MacMahon was informed on his road home (as he heard) that
he would be taken; and he, Robert Rollo Read, Hastings Mason,
once an officer in the Downshire Militia, and John Magennis, took
boat at Bangor and got over to Scotland, and afterwards <em>MacMahon
got to France</em>, where he still is.&mdash;Pp. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>-9.</p></div>

<p>The report and appendix of the Secret Committee is known
to have been edited by Alexander Knox, whom Lord Macaulay
afterwards described as 'a remarkable man.' Mr. Knox was
the private secretary of Lord Castlereagh; and, in compiling
the report for the Government, he disclosed as much of
McMahon's proceedings as was convenient for their purpose.
The Government well knew that McMahon had engaged deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
in treason between the period of his taking boat at Bangor
and getting to France. The second volume of Lord Castlereagh's
Correspondence opens with the following secret letter.
Quigley, or O'Coigly, will be remembered as the unfortunate
priest who was hanged at Maidstone in May 1798:&mdash;</p>

<p>'McMahon, member of the executive committee, a Presbyterian
parson from the County of Down, forced to emigrate in
June last, came over to London, where he met with Quigley, who
was likewise obliged to leave Ireland. They started together in
London, imitating the Patriots in the mode of forming societies
after the plan of the United Irish. They had heard of the
expedition at the Texel being intended for Ireland, and it was
agreed on that an insurrection should be attempted in London,
as soon as the landing was effected in Ireland. Colonel
Despard was to be the leading person, and the King and
Council were to be put to death, &amp;c. Their force was
estimated at 40,000, ready to turn out. McMahon, hearing
he was traced to London, resolved on going for France, and
took Quigley as his interpreter; he got a subscription made
to pay Quigley's expenses, and collected twenty-five guineas,
fifteen of which were given by a Mr. Bell, of the City.</p>

<p>'McMahon and Quigley went over to Cuxhaven, thence
directly to Holland, were on board the fleet, and, when the
expedition went off, proceeded to Paris. They there found
Lewins, but could get no satisfactory answers from him
relative to his communications with the French Government.
A quarrel was the consequence, and Father Quigley was
despatched privately by McMahon to London, to get some
one sent over to represent the Patriots of both nations, and to
replace Lewins.'<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>Seaton Reid, D.D., the able historian of the Presbyterian
Church, says that in 1789 McMahon was ordained to the
pastoral charge of Kilrea, and in 1794 became minister o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>f
Holywood. He is described as a man of daring character,
and considerable literary attainments. Dr. Reid's History
has been continued by Dr. Killen, an ecclesiastical historian
of rank, who found McMahon's subsequent career involved in
great mystery. 'On the Continent,' writes Dr. Killen, 'he
embraced the military profession, and it is said&mdash;with what
truth I know not&mdash;that he became distinguished as General
Mack.' Most notices of Mack, the Austrian general, say that
he died in obscurity, and at a date unknown. It is almost a
pity to disturb the romance with which Dr. Killen has invested
this subject,&mdash;but 'truth is stranger than fiction.' An inquiry
into the life of General Mack is fatal to the suggestion of the
Presbyterian historian.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of Arthur McMahon at Paris is specially noted
in Tone's Diary on February 1, 1798.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Soon after the Hamburg
spy announces, with other facts, that McMahon&mdash;O'Coigly's
companion&mdash;is appointed colonel and aide-de-camp to Napper
Tandy.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> A later letter of secret information, no doubt from
Turner&mdash;who had been a colleague of McMahon when organising
treason in Ulster&mdash;says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>MacMahon has about 300<em>l.</em> sterling, property remitted him by
Charles Rankin of Belfast; this he means to employ in buying a
farm. Tired of politics,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> especially those of France, he is to write
to Citoyen Jean Thomas, √† la Poste restante, √† Hamburg, whom he
looks on as a good patriot.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>The 'Castlereagh Papers' give a secret account of Tandy's
expedition; and how 'Joseph Orr and McMahon the clergyman,
went out in a small corvette of eight guns, to reconnoitre
the Irish coast and to fire signals; but the boat turned
leaky, and they were obliged to put into Flushing, being
chased by the English cruisers. These two refused to go
any more, and went to Boulogne, where they follow privateering.'<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>This is the last we hear of McMahon until he turns up
in the letter of Berthier, the French Minister of War.</p>

<p>It would have been well for McMahon's friends had the
quondam shepherd entered on pastoral work of another sort,
assuming that he seriously entertained the idea, and that it was
not mooted by him to throw Turner off the scent. Turner&mdash;at
this time&mdash;had begun to be suspected, as Reinhard
shows (<i lang="la">ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>). Certain it is, the <em>soi-disant</em> farmer chose
dirtier work than scouring drains, or even spreading manure.
But as his movements with Tandy are secretly reported to
the British Government, it would seem that he had not as yet
become a regular informer. Whatever proposal he made to
Pitt, the bargain was apparently bungled. Unlike others,
his name is not to be found in any pension list. Judging
from the poverty in which Bernadotte found McMahon in
1803, his trade as a spy cannot have been very remunerative.
But increased trade often brings large profits, and his opportunities
for doing good work for Pitt were certainly greater
after 1804.</p>

<p>Experience taught McMahon something. A disappointed
man, willing to spy on behalf of whichever side paid best,
had at least no difficulty in making a choice. How he
gradually acquired facilities for plying his trade with profit
now remains to be shown.</p>

<p>Miles Byrne&mdash;who held a command in the rebel lines at
Vinegar Hill, narrowly escaped with his life, was afterwards
the trusted agent of Robert Emmet in 1803, and became a
colonel in the French service&mdash;supplies in his Memoirs an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
honoured list of 'exiled Irish whom he met in France,' including
'Arthur McMahon.' This would be about the year 1803.
Matthew Dowling, Byrne's host on the occasion, had been
deeply compromised in '98, and his name is often met in the
autobiographies of Cloncurry, Hamilton Rowan, and Moore.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I spent [writes Byrne] one evening at his lodgings in company
with Paul Murray and Arthur MacMahon, and he made us nearly
forget we were far away from our home; he made us proud of
being exiles in a good cause.</p></div>

<p>The statement of the historian of the Presbyterian Church
that the Rev. Arthur McMahon embraced the military profession,
and became distinguished as 'General Mack,' is true
in every particular, except the last three words.</p>

<p>In 1804 the Irish legion was formed by Napoleon, and
McMahon got a commission from Berthier. Colonel Miles
Byrne speaks of McMahon as amongst his 'best friends and
comrades&mdash;we were happy and united.'<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> The risk he ran of a
bear's hug never struck him. 'We could see the masts of the
ships in the bay of Brest, from whence we expected soon to
sail with an army to liberate our beloved country; this view
caused sensations that exiles alone can feel and appreciate.'
Byrne goes on to say that General Sarazan was 'suspected to
have been in the pay of England.' Not one word is dropped
to the prejudice of McMahon.</p>

<p>A great crisis in England's history had now arisen.
Buonaparte was master of Europe. Russia joined him;
Prussia and Austria were all but his serfs; North Germany
was annexed to France. In 1809 the Walcheren expedition&mdash;consisting
of 235 ships and 40,000 land forces&mdash;was
despatched by England with the object of checking Napoleon's
advance into Austria.</p>

<p>Never had a grander fleet left England, or great expectation
been more utterly crushed. After a prolonged bombardment,
Admiral Strahan and Lord Chatham evacuated Walcheren
on December 23, 1809. They returned to England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
but with McMahon a prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> This capture, however,
failed to satisfy Parliament. Angry discussion rose, Canning
and Castlereagh fought a duel, Burdett was lodged in the
Tower, riots rent London, and Lord Chatham resigned to
avoid deeper disgrace.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>Bernadotte, it will be remembered, while admitting that
McMahon had never been entrusted by France with secret
business of importance, yet complains of his inefficiency as
a spy. What but disappointment could ensue? Bourrienne,
the minister of France at Hamburg, learned long after, as he
tells us, that MacMahon gave to England information vastly
exceeding in value anything he told France. England could
pay well when she chose, while the fund available in France
for secret service was shallow and precarious.</p>

<p>As regards the second spy named in Bernadotte's letter to
Berthier, histories of the rebellion may be vainly searched for
any mention of Durnin; nor is it surprising, when we know,
as we now do, that this man had three or four aliases. Nay,
more&mdash;he is sometimes described in the Government reports
merely by an initial! Thus, Wickham encloses to Castlereagh
a letter from Crawford, British minister at Hamburg, in which
he says, 'one D&mdash;&mdash;, alias C&mdash;&mdash;, who murdered Pentland at
Drogheda&mdash;a man much esteemed by Mr. Beresford, is now
here.'<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> The usually exhaustive index to the 'Castlereagh
Correspondence' includes no name resembling Durnin. However,
it turns up in a letter of Wickham to Castlereagh, dated
November 23, 1798, announcing that a vessel named the
'Morgan Rattler' had just arrived at Hamburg from Dublin
with some rebel fugitives, and bearing letters and papers from
Coll, a colonel in the rebel army at Wexford, and 'Duff, alias
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>Campbell, but whose real name,' he adds, 'is <em>Dornan</em>.'<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Lower
down in the letter, Wickham adds that 'Campbell, alias Duff,
but whose real name is Dornan, is said to have been concerned
in the murder of a person of the name of Pentland, or Portland,
near Drogheda.'<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>Here at last one gets upon a long-lost track&mdash;a track, it is
to be feared, of a double-dyed villain. Dalton's 'History of
Drogheda' mentions (ii. 370) that in 1796, shortly after the
arrival of the French fleet in Bantry Bay, 'Mr. Pentland,
surveyor of excise in Drogheda, was inhumanly and wilfully
murdered.'</p>

<p>Officers of excise usually kept a sharp watch on the coast;
and hence, probably, Durnin deemed it well to 'remove' him.
Why Durnin figured under the name of Duff at Drogheda
may have been because it was endeared to the people by
historic tradition. D'Alton&mdash;the historian of Drogheda&mdash;often
mentions the Duffs, and how for faith and fatherland they
suffered attainder in 1691. I cannot find that Durnin attained
any influence in the councils of the United Irishmen; but
McMahon must have been a person of culture and prepossessing
manners to succeed in exciting the sympathy of a
stoical soldier of the Revolution, and who, moreover, had reason
to doubt his fidelity. The name Arthur McMahon is found
in the Fugitive Bill of 1798. But this circumstance affords
no proof that he was not then a spy; for Turner also figures
in the Fugitive Bill, and was afterwards subjected to the mock
penalty of imprisonment. The Banishment Act includes the
name 'John Dorney.' Durnin and Dorney are convertible
names. A gardener named Durnin, or Dorney (for the
peasantry hail him by both names), has been employed in
the author's family for many years.</p>

<p>When one considers the heterogeneous character of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>throng who joined the ranks of the United Irishmen, it is only
surprising that their secrets were so well kept. The late
Frank Thorpe Porter, a well-known police magistrate, gave
me a personal reminiscence not devoid of interest. His father
had been one of the brotherhood; but one dark night in
March 1798, a beggarman having given him 'the secret sign'
in the street, he musingly said, 'By Jove! if our Society includes
such fellows as this, the sooner I get out of it the
better.' He had been a sergeant of grenadiers in the Irish
Volunteers of 1782, and his tall figure may be recognised in
Wheatley's celebrated picture of the review in College Green
under the Duke of Leinster and Lord Charlemont.</p>

<p>Many United Irishmen, whose names do not appear in
history, had escapes as narrow, but on a more modest scale,
as those which favoured Hamilton Rowan. Mr. Porter added
a reminiscence worth preserving. The house of his father, an
eminent Protestant printer, was 69 Grafton Street. The
maidservant had a sweetheart in an opposite house, and one
Sunday evening, while Mrs. Porter was entertaining Dignan,
a proscribed rebel, the domestic left her master's door ajar,
and tripped across the street for a chat. Meanwhile, who
should walk up to Porter's but the city sheriff, holding in his
hand the manuscript of a Proclamation which he required
him to print. Finding that the hall-door gave no resistance,
he proceeded upstairs. Mrs. Porter, thunderstruck, but with
presence of mind, hailed him from the lobby above, exclaiming,
'Oh! <em>Mr. Sheriff</em>, I am very glad to see you.' Dignan took
the alarm that she intended and, seizing a dark table-cover
with which he concealed his person, flung himself under a
pianoforte that stood in a corner. This had hardly been accomplished
when the sheriff entered. 'Sheriff,' said Mrs.
Porter, 'you probably met your friend the Town Major, who
has just gone after having a glass of punch&mdash;take his seat and
make yourself comfortable.' The sheriff, nothing loth, accepted
the proffered hospitality. Mrs. Porter's feelings may
be imagined during the <i lang="fr">mauvais quart d'heure</i> of his stay, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
a single sigh from the outlaw would have sealed not only his
doom, but probably her husband's as well.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Porter did not know what Dignan had done. But I
find, among McNally's secret letters to Dublin Castle, one
enclosing a copy of the 'Union Star,' a revolutionary print,
which, he says, 'has been printed at Dignan's house in
Grafton Street.' A later letter (endorsed May 23, 1798, the
night on which the rebellion burst forth) announces 'Ferris is
the informer against Dignan.' Ferris is described by Musgrave
in his history (p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>) as head of a committee of United
Irishmen, who was waited upon by a blacksmith named Dunne
offering to murder Lord Carhampton, the famous terrorist.
Ferris warned Carhampton, and Dunne with his accomplice
McCarthy was hanged. Frequent payments to Ferris through
Lord Carhampton are recorded in the book of 'Secret Service
Money.' Musgrave notices him as a rather meritorious
man. Who Ferris was McNally tells Cooke in a letter of
secret gossip. 'Ferris, forty years ago, was an attorney and
stripped of his gown for perjury; lived in Green Street; at
present in Castle.'</p>

rebel colonels of the county Down, General Mack was serving in the Netherlands,

delivering over to Napoleon, in virtue of the capitulation of Ulm, 33,000
Austrians as prisoners of war. For this act he was tried at Vienna, and received
sentence of death as a traitor to his country. But Bourrienne denies
that any secret understanding existed between him and Buonaparte. Mack's
sentence having been commuted, he was consigned to an Austrian dungeon,

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

THOMAS REYNOLDS: SPY, AND BRITISH CONSUL</h2>


<p>No greater contrast could be found to the idiosyncrasy of
Magan than that of Thomas Reynolds. If the former was
shy, shrinking, and unobtrusive, Reynolds had indomitable
<em>audace</em>, a fondness for display and luxury, a love of society,
and an effrontery which no rebuff could disconcert. After
several arrests had been made, and when a suspicion of infidelity
rested on him for the first time, Neilson, a powerful
man, meeting him unarmed at night, grasped him by the
throat, and, presenting a pistol, exclaimed, 'What should I do
to the villain who has sought my confidence to betray me?'
Reynolds, with perfect <i lang="fr">sang froid</i>, replied, 'You should shoot
him through the heart!' Neilson, struck by the reply,
changed his purpose and suffered Reynolds to go.</p>

<p>Fourteen delegates from Leinster, as they sat in council
at Bond's, had been arrested on Reynolds's information, and
the sickening fact is told by Dr. Madden that some days after
the arrests he paid a visit of condolence to Mrs. Bond, and
caressed the babe she held in her arms.</p>

<p>But let it not be supposed that he had any share in the
betrayal of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Reynolds held an advantageous
lease of lands under the Leinster family, warmed
to Lord Edward, and, during the period of his outlawry, gave
him some money to meet a pressing call. The Geraldine little
dreamed from what source it was derived. Before the payment
of the 5,000<em>l.</em> to Reynolds he received, early in 1798, 500<em>l.</em>
from Dublin Castle.</p>

<p>Reynolds, a silk mercer, had been persuaded to inform by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Mr. W. Cope, an eminent merchant, who exercised great
influence over him, under circumstances that will be soon
apparent. His grandson, Sir William Cope, Bart., has sent
me the correspondence which attained this end. Cope, in a
memorandum, dated 1799, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I exerted my influence, and, though Mr. Cooke said to me, 'You
<em>must</em> get him to come forward; stop at nothing&mdash;100,000<em>l.</em>&mdash;anything,'
etc., I conditioned with Government for him for only 5,000<em>l.</em>
and 1,000<em>l.</em> per year, and he is satisfied. He came forward at my
repeated intercession.</p></div>

<p>The 'Life of Thomas Reynolds,' by his son, was issued in
1839, with a view to whitewash a sullied memory; the biographer&mdash;not
supposing that the Cope papers existed&mdash;states
that, as compensation for heavy losses, a bulk sum of but
500<em>l.</em> was paid to Reynolds, 'with an annuity of 1,000<em>l.</em> Irish,
with reversion to my mother, my brother and myself.'<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>The accounts of Secret Service Money have also turned
up to bear out Cope's statement and confront Reynolds junior.
It appears, under date of March 4, 1799, that Reynolds received
on that day not 500<em>l.</em>, but the completion of a sum of 5,000<em>l.</em>
As regards the pension, it continued to be paid for near
forty years, and it has been computed that he drew altogether
45,740<em>l.</em></p>

<p>The information which had been dropping from Reynolds,
sometimes not as freely as had been hoped, received a stimulus
by his arrest at Athy on May 5, 1798. He writes to Mr. Cope
that he has been thrown into a dungeon, and demands from
the Government, what they well know he merits, instant enlargement.
He refers to the great and essential services he
had rendered to Government, and adds that by his confinement
he is totally prevented from obtaining and giving further
knowledge. Then it was that Cope settled the terms with
Cooke. Cope's powerful influence over Reynolds was due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the fact that the latter had gradually become his slave as a
creditor to a large extent. Sir William Cope<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> has sent me a
letter from Reynolds's wife to show the falsity of the biographer's
assertion that he had made no terms with the Crown
for his information. It appears from a letter of Reynolds that
the wife was empowered to act for him, and among the terms
required were, 'that he might settle in any part of England he
liked, receive from the Government letters of introduction, recommending
him and family to the particular attention of the
gentry of the place;' the pension to commence on June 25,
1798, with 5,000<em>l.</em> in hand; in conclusion she begs Cope to
advance on loan 1,000<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>These and other references to monetary transactions led
me to search the Registry of Deeds Office, and the following
result appears: '1794&mdash;Thos. Reynolds of West Park Street
Dublin to Wm. Cope. Consideration 5041<em>l.</em> 14<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em> Lands of
Corbetstown, King's Co.'</p>

<p>The fact that Reynolds was obliged to borrow this sum
shows the erroneousness of Lord Castlereagh's statement in
Parliament, 'that he was a gentleman in considerable circumstances.'
Fresh proof of the wisdom of the proverb (xxii. 7),
'the borrower is servant to the lender,' is afforded by this
episode. In the case of Higgins and Magan, the treachery of
the latter to Lord Edward was entirely due to the fact that
Higgins had bound him, hand and foot, in bonds more inextricable
than those by which Mephistopheles sought to enchain
his victim. Shamado got the lion's share of the blood money
earned by that betrayal. Cope, though a man of great wealth,
and professing to have influenced Reynolds solely from a sense
of moral duty, obtained a pension of 1,000<em>l.</em> a year for his
wife, with reversion to his three daughters.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Cope survived
until December 7, 1820, when he died at his house in Hume
Street, Dublin. His three daughters never married. The
foregoing inquiries have been invited by the son and biographer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>of Reynolds, who, seeking to pillory Dr. Taylor, author
of the 'Civil Wars,' writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Perhaps Mr. Taylor could furnish me with the records from
which he discovered that my father was distressed from want of
money.' He may, perhaps, consider Mr. Moore's 'Life of Lord
Edward Fitzgerald' as a record, or Mr. Moore himself as an historian,
of small value; but I shall notice his work in another place,
I shall confine myself for the present to Mr. Taylor. 'From what
source,' he asks, 'did Mr. Taylor discover that my father had been an
active member of the Union? and, above all, from what record did
he receive the foul slander that he had sold the secret to Government?
Could not the same record have supplied him with the
price also; and, if so, why did he not name it? From what records
did he learn that my father had insured to himself by his conduct
even the slightest reward? The whole accusation is as false as it
is malicious.'<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p></div>

<p>Among other damaging things alleged against Reynolds
on the trials of Bond, Byrne, and McCan were that he had
stolen his mother's jewellery and had afterwards poisoned her,
and that he had broken several oaths; and it was sworn by
five respectable witnesses that they did not believe him worthy
of credit on his oath.</p>

<p>A small incident, which has never appeared in print, may
perhaps be given here. The guard which seized the fourteen
delegates at Bond's house entered by means of a password.
This we shall presently know, and Major Sirr had Reynolds
to thank for the information, though the father of a late police
magistrate&mdash;Mr. Porter&mdash;lay for a time under the stigma. Wm.
Porter&mdash;in whose house Dignan will be remembered as having
had a narrow escape from arrest&mdash;met Oliver Bond one day
on Cork Hill, Dublin, and asked him, as a United Brother, for
a list of the signs and passwords employed on special occasions.
Bond replied: 'Call at my house on Monday evening
next, making sure to ask as you enter, "Is Ivers from Carlow
come?"' Porter was on his way to keep this appointment
when he met Luke White&mdash;the founder of the Annaly peerage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>&mdash;who
asked him to accompany him to Crampton Court close
by, where some business was transacted between the two&mdash;one
being a printer and the other a publisher. An hour was thus
consumed, and Porter on arriving at Bond's&mdash;it was Monday,
March 12, 1798&mdash;found a cordon of soldiers round the house.
Reynolds, who held the rank of colonel in the rebel organisation,
was not then suspected; and it was Oliver Bond's conviction,
freely expressed, that William Porter had betrayed the
password to Sirr. For this suspicion he made frank atonement.
Bond's trial did not come on for three months, and
the interval proved one of much anxiety to Porter. Then it
was that Reynolds excited much surprise by entering the
witness-box. Bond, recognising Porter in court, stretched
forth his arm across the necks of his keepers, and shook the
hand of the man he had wronged.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>Reynolds, unlike Magan, who seemed content with the
crumbs which fell from 'Shamado's' hand, was less easily
satisfied. In 1810 he got the postmastership at Lisbon, the
emoluments of which for four years amounted to 5,600<em>l.</em>, after
which he became British Consul at Iceland; but, not liking
the post, he coolly returned to London without leave, when
the following scene took place between himself and Mr. Cooke,
formerly Under-Secretary at Dublin Castle. Reynolds's son
thus tells what passed: '"You are a madman; you are an
imprudent; I tell you so to your face; and you were always
an imprudent man, and never will be otherwise. I tell you,
you are considered as a passionate, imprudent man." "Mr.
Cooke," said my father, "if I was not so, perhaps Ireland would
not at this day be a part of the British Empire: you did not
think me passionate or imprudent in 1798." "I tell you again,"
said Mr. Cooke, "you are mad. Well, what do you intend to
do now?" "Really," said my father, "I intend to do nothing
at all; I suppose Lord Castlereagh, on his return, will settle
my resignation." ... "Lord Castlereagh," continued Mr.
Cooke, "knows you to be a very imprudent man, and he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
certainly hesitate at allowing you to be in London, where your
imprudence would give advantage to your enemies to bring
you into trouble, and him too. He does not like you to be in
London: I tell you fairly that is the feeling."'<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>Lord Castlereagh then filled the critical post of Minister
for Foreign Affairs. A formidable Opposition daily questioned
and tormented him. The horror of Mathias on hearing 'the
Bells' can hardly have been greater than that of Castlereagh
whenever Reynolds's ring sounded at his door.
Reynolds refused to freeze any longer in Iceland, and,
after some delay, was appointed consul at Copenhagen.
He soon got tired of it, and coolly installed his son there
as vice-consul; but, on Canning succeeding to Castlereagh,
after the suicide of the latter, he sent young Reynolds
adrift. Meanwhile the sire divided his residence between
Paris and London. He constantly crossed Castlereagh's path,
posing before him as an ill-used man and largely helping to
drive him mad. The cupidity of Reynolds is described as
insatiable. In 1817, Thistlewood, Watson, and Hooper were
indicted for treason; true bills were found by the grand jury
of Middlesex; but the name of Thomas Reynolds having
appeared on the panel, much wrath found vent, and a feeling
of disgust passed over England. The press took up the subject,
and Parliament resounded with 'Reynolds, the Irish
informer.'</p>

<p>Society snubbed him, but still his chariot went round the
Row day by day. After Castlereagh's death he removed
permanently to Paris, where he loved to parade his pompous
person, and became as well known in the Champs-Elys√©es as
Charles X. or Louis Philippe. Some lines scribbled at this
time illustrate the feelings with which thinkers of a certain
type watched his diurnal progress:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lolling at his vile ease in chariot gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face, nay, even his fearful name, unhidden!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncloaked abroad, 'neath all the eyes of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which&mdash;as he passeth&mdash;close, while breath is hushed,&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unspat upon, untrampled down, uncrushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've seen the seven-fold traitor! &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Reynolds had a habit of leaving his card on men the
buckles of whose shoes he was unworthy to burnish. Amongst
others whom he thought that by doing so he honoured, was
Dr. Daniel Haliday, of Paris, who represented a family distinguished
in Irish letters. In Haliday's hall there hung a
fine portrait of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Turning its face
to the wall, and sticking Reynolds's card on it, he said to his
servant: 'When he again comes, refer him to this picture.'
Reynolds, of course, repeated the visit, and felt the rebuff the
more because Lord Edward was not among the men he had
betrayed. The late Charles Haliday, to whom I owe this
story of his uncle, shared the rather general belief as to Reynolds
having informed against the Geraldine, while the now
convicted Magan, who lived close to Charles Haliday on the
banks of the Liffey, failed to incur his suspicion.</p>

<p>One fine day in August 1836, when Paris was <i lang="fr">en f√™te</i>,
Reynolds died, and his remains were brought to England
and consigned to the vaults of Wilton Church, Yorkshire.
By a coincidence Dr. Haliday died at the same time, as
appears from his epitaph in the picturesque graveyard of
Dundrum near Dublin. When struck down by death at Paris,
he had been engaged on a History of the Irish Brigade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

ARMSTRONG AND THE SHEARESES&mdash;GENERAL LAWLESS</h2>


<p>Armstrong was another man who, unlike Turner and Magan,
boldly betrayed, and by baring his name to popular odium,
bared his breast to its penalties. He lived to old age in a
district specially burrowed by agrarian crime; but, though
often taunted with his treachery, never suffered a pin-scratch
at the hands of the people.</p>

<p>Before Armstrong comes on the scene it is well to give
some account of the men he so cruelly betrayed.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> This
becomes the more imperative, inasmuch as unpublished
letters of Sheares, containing important explanations, were
placed in my hands for historic use by the late Mr. Justice
Hayes.</p>

<p>The father of John and Henry Sheares was a banker
and member of the Irish Parliament, remarkable for having
introduced a bill, which became law in 1766, for the regulation
of trials in cases of treason, and under which his sons
were afterwards tried. He was a person of culture, too,
author of some touching reflections on 'Man in Society, and
at his Final Separation from it.' Several passages seem to
reveal a presentiment of the great domestic tragedy which he
did not live to see. A practical Christian, he published an
essay elaborating the great fact that unless man forgives, he
can never himself be forgiven; and these inculcations, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
hoped, helped to calm the closing thoughts of his suffering
sons. Mr. Sheares founded a Debtors' Charity in Cork, and an
amateur performance of 'King Henry IV.,' in aid of it, introduced
as its chief histrions the subsequently historic brothers.
Their career was highly dramatic. Henry successfully competed
for the hand of Miss Swete with a young barrister, Mr.
John FitzGibbon, who, as the Lord Clare of after years, is
said to have shown that he neither forgot nor forgave. In
1792 Henry Sheares visited France to see his children at
school. The Revolution was then at its height; he and his
brother John became intimate with Brissot and Rolande, and
thenceforth may be dated the birth of that bias which finally
made both easy prey for Armstrong. In July 1793, Henry
Sheares challenged his early rival, now Lord FitzGibbon, to
explain or retract what he called an 'infamous calumny,' conveyed
in a speech wherein the chancellor referred to two men,
agents of the French Jacobin Club, who had employed themselves
in disseminating its principles in Dublin. But even John
Sheares was not the revolutionist which party spirit loved to
depict him. A letter appears in the 'Castlereagh Papers,' in
which the writer, Redhead York, describes John Sheares at
Versailles, falling on his knees and vowing that he would
plant a poignard in the heart of any person who would hurt a
hair on the head of the Queen of France. In 1792 Henry, a
barrister of some years' standing, secured the house, 128 Lower
Baggot Street, Dublin, now the Ulster Bank. It was at that
time a corner house; but Sheares, shortly before his death,
assigned a plot of ground adjoining it whereon the two houses
between Sheares's residence and Pembroke Street were built.
The large block of buildings between St. Stephen's Green and
Sheares's house did not then exist. Miss Steele saw, from her
father's back windows in the Green, the soldiers surrounding
Sheares's home when, in May 1798, treason was deemed
sufficiently ripe for a <em>coup</em>. John Sheares, the junior of
Henry by nine years, lived with him, and the utmost fraternal
love subsisted between both.</p>

<p>Captain John Warneford Armstrong, the descendant of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Scotch settler in Ireland, was at heart a supporter of oligarchical
principles, but acted so well the part of a flaming
patriot, that Byrne, a democratic bookseller, led Armstrong
to his private room and presented him to Sheares as 'a true
brother on whom you may implicitly depend.' Henry declined
to hold converse unless in presence of his brother John.
Armstrong said he would wait until John came. Conversation,
however, had commenced before his arrival; he at length
appeared with Byrne, and the latter introduced Armstrong in
an equally impressive way. Armstrong deposed on the trial
that John Sheares said&mdash;'I know your principles very well,'
and asked him to join the cause by action as he had already
done by inclination. Armstrong replied&mdash;'I am ready to do
everything in my power for it, and if you can show me how I
can assist I will serve you to the utmost.' John, an impulsive
youth, said that the best way he could help was to gain over
the soldiery, and confer with him as to the best way of seizing
the royal camp. Armstrong appointed to meet him at Baggot
Street with this end; he did so, and on Sunday night, May
13, paid another visit&mdash;both brothers being present. On the
15th he called twice; John Sheares said he would like to
introduce him to a friend of his, Surgeon (afterwards General)
Lawless, with whom he might consult and advise in his
absence&mdash;he [John] being obliged to go down and organise
Cork. All this time Henry Sheares is found reticent, and at
some of the interviews he was not present at all. However,
on Thursday, the 17th, both brothers appeared to this apparently
zealous convert to their cause; Lawless was also
by, and (according to Armstrong's testimony) said: 'He had
lately attended a meeting of deputies from almost all the
militia regiments, at which meeting there were two of his
[the approver's] men.'</p>

<p>Henry Sheares, now familiar with Armstrong as his guest
and constant visitor, let fall some remarks by which the
betrayer succeeded in implicating him as having knowledge of
the military organisation. This was not enough for Armstrong;
that evening he returned to their house. Henry did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
not appear; John came down and obtained a written introduction
from him to a sergeant in his regiment, known to be
a United Irishman. The most sickening part of this story
has yet to be told. Armstrong continued to worm himself
into the hearts of his victims. He accepted their invitations
to dinner, mingled with their family, listened to Mrs. Sheares
singing at the harp for his entertainment, and, as Curran
declared, fondled on his knee the child of the man whom he
had marked for doom!</p>

<p>The time was now coming, and coming fast, when the
blood of the Sheares was to be set free&mdash;a fact the more
painful, when we know that two of their brothers had already
given their lives in the service of the King. Armstrong in
the year 1843 said, in presence of Mr., afterwards Lord,
O'Hagan, that 'Lord Castlereagh persuaded him to dine with
the Sheares with a view to gather further information.'
Dogging their steps, scenting their hot blood, and measuring
the days they had to live, he at last gave tongue, and on May
21 both brothers were seized. That evening, while John was
a prisoner, but as yet ignorant of Armstrong's perfidy, the
betrayer is found paying him a visit of condolence, probably
hoping to gather, during the excitation of his victim, facts
which would compromise absent friends. Any evidence which
could incriminate Henry was far less than that affecting John.
It is surprising that the wonderful caution shown by Sheares
when a younger man should not have made him more guarded
in his intercourse with Armstrong; and at this point it is
curious to look back at Collins's report (p. <a href="#Page_168">168</a> <i lang="la">ante</i>) where he
describes Sheares warning the Society of United Irishmen
that spies were spreading snares around.</p>

<p>Anyone reading this trial, with the light now available,
cannot fail to be struck by a circumstance which has heretofore
passed without comment. The outlook was black for the
brothers when their counsel, Plunket, Curran, McNally, and
Ponsonby, held a conference to see what could be done. A
good point was at last detected; one of the Grand Jury who
found the bill appeared to be a foreigner, or, as legally termed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
an alien. Law books had to be looked up; some searching
inquiries made. McNally, meanwhile, had been despatched
to the Court of Common Pleas to appease the judges, who had
been waiting for some time and waxed impatient. McNally
explained that there was a deliberation among the counsel on
a serious point of law, and, until they came in, he could say
no more. The court made an effort to draw him, but he
parried it with seeming firmness. The case stood adjourned,
and when Plunket, Curran, and Ponsonby arrived to spring a
surprise, they found Attorney-General Toler (the Lord Norbury
of after years) fully prepared, not only by a written 'replication'
bristling with points, but by an elaborate oral argument,
and, between him and the prime-sergeant, they met the
objection with a readiness quite wonderful, and which meant
ruin to the brothers. The court of course overruled a plea
which counsel for the Sheareses hoped would have quashed the
proceedings, and it cannot be doubted that the point had been
betrayed to Toler by one of the counsel engaged in the
conference.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General said he would go on with the trial
of John; but at another conference of their counsel it was
decided, in evil hour, that both brothers should go into the
dock together and join in their challenge. The luckless suggestion
is likely to have come from McNally. Curran was not
a great lawyer, his <em>forte</em> lay in cross-examination and classic
eloquence; he revered McNally, as has been already shown,
and he was not the man to differ with him. Two witnesses,
it will be remembered, were then necessary to convict for
treason in England; the Irish judiciary were satisfied with
one. The amazement of the Sheares on beholding Armstrong
enter the witness-box can be guessed. Curran drew a picture
of the children of his client sitting in the mansion where
Armstrong was hospitably entertained&mdash;the aged mother
supported by the devotion of her son&mdash;and it was suggested
that the informer 'smiled upon this scene, contemplating the
havoc he was about to make.' Midnight had passed when the
evidence closed. Armstrong's first cousin, Thomas Drought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
testified, among other damaging facts, to atheistical expressions
used by the approver.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Lieutenant Shervington, an uncle
by marriage, heard Armstrong say 'that if there could be no
other person found for the purpose, he would, with pleasure,
become the executioner of George III., and glory in the deed.'
His uncle replied that if such were his principles he ought to
throw up his commission and go over to the enemy at once.</p>

<p>When the trial had proceeded for fifteen hours, Curran,
sinking with exhaustion, moved for an adjournment, but
Toler opposed, and at eight o'clock next morning a verdict of
'Guilty' was returned. At these words the brothers fell into
each other's arms. At three o'clock both were brought up
for judgment. Lord Carleton, who presided, was said to have
been appointed by Sheares's father the guardian of John, but
it is correct to say that he had been only the attached friend
of their father.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> This judge was visibly affected, and made
touching reference to the past. John, with his full blue eyes
and open countenance, as Maria Steele describes him, made
an earnest appeal for his elder brother's life, declaring that he
knew nothing of a fatal manuscript that, admittedly written
by John, had been found in Henry's desk; all in vain: Toler
seemed impatient for the sacrifice, and both were sentenced
to be hanged next day. Sir Jonah Barrington prints a painful
letter addressed to him by Henry, but which by some
mistake did not reach him, he says, till the fatal morning.
Henry could not believe that an adverse verdict awaited him,
and when at last it came, he was utterly stunned by the blow.
Sheares begs Barrington to see Lord Clare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh! speak to him of my poor wretched family&mdash;my distracted
wife, and my helpless children; snatch them from the dreadful
horrors which await them. Desire my mother to go to Lord
Shannon immediately, and my wife to the Lord Chancellor....
We are to receive sentence at three o'clock. Fly, I beseech you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>and save a man who will never cease to pray for you&mdash;to serve
you. Let me hear from you, my dear fellow, as quick as possible.
God bless you.</p>

<p>
Newgate: eight o'clock.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Sheares's wife sat for hours in a sedan chair at Lord Clare's
hall-door; and when, at length, he appeared, she threw herself
at his feet, clasped his knees, and implored him to save
her husband, but failed. Barrington, tardily acting upon
Henry's letter, had more influence with the chancellor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I immediately waited on Lord Clare [he writes]; he read the
letter with great attention; I saw he was moved&mdash;his heart yielded.
I improved on the impression; he only said 'What a coward he is!
but what can we do?' He paused. 'John Sheares cannot be
spared. Do you think Henry can say anything, or make any
species of discovery which can authorise the Lord Lieutenant in
making a distinction between them?&mdash;if so, Henry may be reprieved.'
He read the letter again, and was obviously affected. I
had never seen him amiable before. 'Go,' said he, 'to the Prison,
see Henry Sheares, ask him this question, and return to me at
Cooke's office.' I lost no time, but I found on my arrival that
orders had been given that nobody should be admitted without
a written permission. I returned to the Castle&mdash;they were all
at Council. Cooke was not at his office: I was delayed. At
length the secretary returned, gave me the order. I hastened
to Newgate, and arrived at the very moment the executioner was
holding up the head of my friend, and saying, 'Here is the head of
a traitor.'<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p></div>

<p>Barrington says nothing of Lord Shannon, who was related
to the Sheareses, and it is certain that the message for him
miscarried. This peer, with the object of offering condolence,
called upon their mother<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> the day of the execution, and was
greatly distressed when she threw herself upon her knees
to beg the favour of his intervention for John; she did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>know that Henry had been implicated, and, of course, was
ignorant that either had already suffered death. Lord
Shannon, in an agony of mind, and unable to explain, rushed
from the room.</p>

<p>There was a butchery displayed in the immolation of the
brothers which, if employed at the present day on a beast in
the shambles, would evoke angry protest. The 'New Cork
Evening Post' of July 23, 1798, while supplying some
painful details, bears out Barrington's recollection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They requested that they might not continue long exposed to
the gaze of the multitude, and, having each an halter fixed round
his neck, and a cap drawn over his face, holding by each other's
hand, they tottered out upon the platform in front of the prison.
In making the rope fast within, John Sheares was hauled up to the
block of the tackle, and continued nearly a minute suspended alone
before the platform fell. It did fall, and instantly both were
suspended. After hanging about twenty minutes, they were, at a
quarter after three o'clock, let down, when the hangman separated
their heads.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p></div>

<p>Much feeling was roused by this sanguinary act. Classic
students who lived in the past started in horror, comparing
the Sheareses to 'the hapless victims' described by Gibbon:
'the two brothers of the Quintilian family whose fraternal
love endeared them to posterity&mdash;whose bodies seemed
animated by one soul&mdash;and whose union in death is due to
the cruelty of Commodus.' Grattan loudly condemned the
men 'whose misrule had brought Ireland to so black a crisis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
The question men should have asked was, not why was Mr.
Sheares upon the gallows?&mdash;but why was not Lord Clare
along with him?' And two years later, in a speech of
resistance to the Union, he declared that the treason of the
minister against the liberties of the people was far worse than
the rebellion of the people against the minister. But even in
the latter sense, Henry Sheares must be held guiltless. John,
pouring out to his sister, in an agonised letter, his most secret
thoughts, writes: 'Heaven is my witness how assiduously I
sought to keep aloof, in any of my political concerns, from
<em>him</em>;' and there is not a line in the evidence of Armstrong to
prove that Henry took any active part in the treason. Addis
Emmet, Arthur O'Connor, McNevin&mdash;all the men who had
been at the head of it, and its very soul, were at that hour in
gaol. O'Connor declared that he and his colleagues knew
nothing of the Sheareses; and it is certain that neither of them
had ever intrigued with France, as O'Connor and the others
had done. The names of the Sheareses find no place in the list
of marked men that Turner gave Downshire (p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>, <i lang="la">ante</i>).
This omission can be easily accounted for. Arthur O'Connor,
in a letter to Dr. Madden, which pointed out some inaccuracies,
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You seem to think the Sheares were leading men in the Union,<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
whereas, I may say, they never entered it, so as to be known to us.
The fact is, they were just entering it when they were cut off. It
was the younger Sheares's Proclamation, which was an act purely
personal, without the knowledge or concurrence of the Union, that
has misled some to think he and his brother were deeply engaged
in the Union.'</p></div>

<p>The following is one of the letters, already promised, and
now published for the first time. It is written by Henry
previous to his trial:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Accept my best thanks for the friendly readiness
with which you consented to present my letter, which I hope has
been received. I am now to trouble you on a subject more immediately
relating to my unfortunate situation. I have apply'd as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>is usual in those cases to my different Friends to come forward on
my tryal, and to give me a character such as they think I deserve,
and to put it in a manner most likely to produce a beneficial effect.
From my knowledge of the goodness of your heart, from a sympathy
which I am sure you feel for a fond husband and an affectionate
father, from the regard which I am sure you have for Mrs. Sheares,
I feel a hope that in this instance you will gladly embrace this
opportunity of saving us both. You know that on these occasions
a general character is not admissable so that it must apply to the
political character. And so far to the domestic as will go to establish
the political.</p>

<p>Taking it this way may I hope that you can say that you know
me to be a man of domestic habits, fondly attached to my wife and
children, so as to make it highly improbable that I would suffer my
political conduct to endanger their happiness; that you consider
me a man of liberal but not violent principles; that I go no farther
in them than the first characters of opposition in the English and
Irish Parliament have done, namely being an advocate for a reform
in Parliament and a renovation of the ancient purity of our constitution;
that I am not a friend to violent systems, and that I am
not an advocate for Revolution.</p>

<p>This is what, from your knowledge of me, I trust you can say
without going farther than will justify you to yourself. And for
this friendly service I shall seize with pleasure every opportunity of
showing how much I shall feel myself obliged to you for it.</p>

<p>As it is usual and necessary for the use of counsel to have the
witnesses' names which they are to prove arranged in the brief, I
have given directions to my agent to wait on you for that purpose
whenever it may be convenient to you, as also to go through the
form of giving you a summons.</p>

<p class="right">
Your very much obliged and grateful Friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Henry Sheares</span>.</p>

<p>The superscription of this letter has been removed&mdash;probably
by the recipient&mdash;and it seems very likely that he left
his friend in the lurch, and did not come forward for his
defence. The prosecuting counsel of those days loved to taunt
such witnesses with a participation in the views held by the
accused; they were browbeaten and bullied, and often left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>

jibing leer.</p>

<p>John, the younger brother, wrote two letters to his sister,
from which it is clear that&mdash;constituted as the jury panel
was at that day&mdash;he had no hope of acquittal. The matter
omitted deals with sundry small debts which he desired should
be paid:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Kilmainham Prison: July 10, 1798.</p>

<p>The troublesome scene of life, my dear Julia, is nearly closed,
and the hand that now traces these lines will in a day or two be
no longer capable of communicating to a beloved and affectionate
family the sentiments of his heart. A painful task yet awaits me.
I do not allude to my trial, or my execution. These&mdash;were it not
for the consciousness I feel of the misery you all will suffer on my
account&mdash;would be trivial in comparison with the pain I endure in
addressing you for the last time. You, Julia, who have been kind
to me beyond example; your solicitudes for my welfare have been
unremitting, nor did they leave you a moment's happiness. As a
wayward fate seems from the earliest moment of my life to have
presided over my days, I will not now recapitulate the instances of
a perverse destiny that seems to mark me out as the instrument
of destruction to all I love. Robert&mdash;Richard&mdash;and Christopher,
dear, valued brothers! If it be true that the mind survives the
body, I shall shortly join you, and learn for what wise purpose
Heaven thought fit to select me as your destroyer! My mother
too&mdash;Oh! God! my tender revered mother, I see her torn looks&mdash;her
broken heart&mdash;her corpse! What have I done to deserve this
misery? I must forbear these thoughts as much as possible, or I
must forbear to write.</p>

<p>My trial comes on the day after to-morrow, and the event is
unequivocal. You must summon up all the resolution of your soul,
my dear Julia; if there be a chance of snatching my afflicted
mother from the grave, that chance must arise from your exertions;
my darling Sally, too, will aid you; she will, for a while, suspend
her joy at the restoration of her husband to her arms&mdash;for of his
escape I have no more doubt than I have of my own conviction and
its consequences. All, all of you must forget your individual griefs
and joys, and unite to save that best of parents from the grave;
stand between her and despair; if she will speak of me, sooth her
with every assurance calculated to carry consolation to her heart;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
tell her that my death&mdash;though nominally ignominious&mdash;should not
light up a blush in her face; that she knew me incapable of a dishonourable
action or thought; that I died in full possession of the
esteem of all those who knew me intimately; that justice will yet
be paid to my memory, and my fate be mentioned rather with pride
than shame by my friends and relations. Yes, my dear sister, if I
did not expect the arrival of this justice to my memory, I should
indeed be afflicted at the nominal ignominy of my death, lest it
should injure your welfare, and wound the feelings of my family.
But, above all things, tell her that at my own request I have been
attended in my latest moments by that excellent and pious man,
Doctor Dobbin, and that my last prayer was offered up for her.
While I feared for Harry's life, hell itself could have no tortures for
the guilty beyond what I suffered. I pictured you all, a helpless,
unprotected group of females, left to the miseries of your own
feelings, and to the insults of a callous, insensible world. Sally, too,
stripped of a husband on whom she tenderly doats, and the children
of their father&mdash;and all by my cursed interloping, and by my residence
with them! Yet, Heaven is my witness, how assiduously I
sought to keep aloof in any of my political concerns from him. My
efforts, however, have kept him clear of any of those matters that
have involved me in destruction. When Sally has got him back to
her arms, and that I, who caused his danger, and her unhappiness,
am no more, she will cease to think of me, perhaps, with reproach.
This I trust she will do; she ought, for she herself could
never have done more for his salvation than I endeavoured to do.
But the scene is changed, I am no longer the frantic thing I was
while his danger appeared imminent. A calm sorrow for the sufferings
that await you on my account, and a heart-felt regret at
being obliged to quit your beloved society for ever, has succeeded;
yet all this will soon have an end, and with comfort I already anticipate
the moment when your subsiding grief gives you back to the
enjoyment of each other. Still, my dearest Julia, even when I shall
be no more, your plagues on my account are not likely to cease....</p>

<p>Good night, Julia. I am going to rest, thank God! free from the
consciousness of intentional offence, and from any wish tainted with
personal resentment.</p></div>

<p>It is now eleven o'clock, and I have only time to address my

whatever be thy name and nature, who has created us the frail and
imperfect creatures we are, hear the ardent prayer of a creature now
on the eve of an awful change. If thy Divine Providence can be
affected by mortal supplication, hear and grant, I beseech Thee, the
last wishes of a heart that has ever adored Thy goodness. Let
peace and happiness once more visit the bosom of my beloved
family. Let a mild grief succeed the miseries they have endured,
and when an affectionate tear is generously shed over the dust of
him who caused their misfortunes&mdash;let all their ensuing days glide
on in union and domestic harmony. Enlighten my beloved brother;
to him and his invaluable wife grant the undisturbed enjoyment of
their mutual love, and as they advance let their means of providing
for the sweet pledges of their attachment increase. Let my Julia,
my feeling&mdash;my too feeling&mdash;Julia, feel the consolation she has
so often sought for others, let her soul repose at length in the consummation
of all her wishes&mdash;let her taste that happiness her
virtues have so well merited. For my other sisters provide those
comforts their situation requires. To my mother, oh, Eternal
Power! what gift shall I wish for my matchless parent? Restore
to her that peace which I have torn from her&mdash;let her forget me in
the ceaseless affections of my remaining sisters, and in their growing
prosperity&mdash;let her taste that happiness which is best suited to her
affectionate heart, and when at length she is called home, let her
find in everlasting bliss the due reward of a life of suffering virtue.
Adieu, my Julia, my light is just out, the approach of darkness is
like that of death, since both alike require I shall say farewell for
ever. Oh, my dear family, farewell&mdash;farewell for ever!</p></div>

<p>The sealed chest in Dublin Castle, which was opened some
years ago, contained McNally's secret reports, signed 'J. W.'
Among them is the following, dated by McNally, July 14,
1798:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><em>Lord Cork's First Letter</em>
</p>

<p>Lord Cork writes: 'Mr. John Warneford Armstrong was certainly
in my regiment and quitted it in a most disgraceful manner.
From his conduct while there I would not pay much attention to
what he did say, nor give much credit even to his oath.</p>

<p>'I would send a person on purpose did I not think it would be
too late.'</p>

<p>
[Dated by Lord Cork, July 9.]<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><em>Lord Cork's Second Letter, dated 11th</em>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Mr. Sheares's letter did not reach me till to-day. I lose no time
to inform the Lord Lieutenant circumstances concerning Mr. Armstrong
that I hope may be of service to the unfortunate brothers.'<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> ...</p>

<p>It has transpired [adds McNally], perhaps without foundation,
that amnesty is to be held out to-morrow&mdash;chearfulness is the consequence.</p>

<p>The letters above alluded to are in the hands of <em>my friend</em> [<em>i.e.</em>
himself]. He has kept them private.</p></div>

<p>Sheares and McNally had been old friends. Sheares stood
by him in the hour of danger.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> These ties were strengthened
by the fact that McNally was counsel for him on the trial.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
Assuming that McNally had the letters in his possession of
which he sends copies, it seems quite indefensible to have
kept back Lord Cork's, dated July 9, until the very day on
which the brothers were hanged. The execution took place
in Dublin at 11¬∑45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on July 14, 1798. Sir Jonah Barrington
mentions that a reprieve was granted but did not arrive in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>time. It cannot be assumed that McNally humanely used
these letters in any other quarter, for, as he assures Cooke,
he 'has kept them private.'</p>

<p>Sir Jonah Barrington, who was constantly consulted by
the Irish Government, says, when noticing Armstrong's evidence
against the Sheares, that, unlike Reynolds&mdash;a man of
spotted fame and impoverished finances&mdash;'Armstrong had a
stake and a status to lose; but he took the bold course of
sacrificing openly the honour of an officer and a gentleman.'
These words he would not use had Lord Cork's letter seen
the light.</p>

<p>Armstrong, forty-five years after the execution of his
victims, held, in a conversation with Dr. Madden, that Curran's
statement as to taking 'baby Sheares' on his knee could not
be true because he was never fond of children. An unscrupulous
man, however, playing a desperate game, and in
the excitement of hot pursuit, may have done things contrary
to his usual habits. Armstrong's sole effort was to extort the
confidence of the Sheares; and he could not forget that he
who takes the child by the hand takes the parent by the
heart. It is to be feared that Armstrong's oral 'pooh pooh' is
untenable. The following anecdote, now told for the first
time, rests on the high authority of Lawrence Parsons, Earl
of Ross. Armstrong, shortly after the death of the Sheareses,
when landing from Holyhead at the Pigeon House, and
anxious to avoid hostile greetings from the mob who always
awaited the coach which brought to Dublin the usually seasick
passengers, crossed the Strand to Sandymount, and when
midway observed approaching a lady in black accompanied by
two children. The latter on recognising Armstrong ran
gleefully to meet him.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Needless to say they were the widow
and orphans of Henry Sheares. Another authentic anecdote
ought to be told. The grand-aunt of Mr. Gray, F.T.C.D., gave
him the following curious reminiscence. Her family resided
near Armstrong in the King's County, and he was intimate at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>their house. One evening in 1797 the lady heard angry voices
in the parlour, where she had left the gentlemen after dinner,
and on turning the handle to re-enter a loud smash followed.
Armstrong had talked so much treason that it excited her
brother to disgust; and this feeling gave place to rage when
Armstrong, having left the room for some minutes, had returned
dressed in rebel green. The former seized a decanter and
hurled it at Armstrong, who ducked, and the panel suffered
instead of his head.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Dobbin, who attended the brothers at their
execution, now claims to be heard in a letter published for
the first time. It is addressed to Captain William Flemyng,
a cousin of the Sheareses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Finglas: July 16, 1798.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,&mdash;Agreeably to your desire I send the letter which
Mr. John Sheares addressed to me, and which I received from his
own hands on Saturday morning after his participating in the most
solemn rite of our religion. However criminal I may consider his
conduct to have been in other respects, of the charges from which
he is so anxious his memory may be vindicated I acquit him from
my soul; under this conviction I shall chearfully comply with his
request, and embrace every opportunity of explaining his real intentions
in writing the paper which has so much irritated the public
mind. You, I trust, will exert yourself in a similar manner; when
you have taken a copy of the letter you will be so good as to return
it. The two unfortunate brothers, who forfeited their lives last
Saturday to the violated laws of their country, were the sons of an
eminent banker in Cork with whom I had lived, many years since,
in intimacy and friendship. The elder brother I was but slightly
acquainted with, but Mr. John Sheares I knew more intimately.
I admired his uncommon talents, and still more the distinguished
humanity and philanthropy which marked the whole of his conversation
and demeanour. It was, therefore, with equal surprise and
concern I heard of his being under confinement on a charge of high
treason. With still greater astonishment, if possible, I heard a
paper had been found in his handwriting, the tendency of which
was to excite the people to violent and sanguinary proceedings:
this was so entirely irreconcileable with the humane and liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
principles which I was persuaded had ever directed the conduct of
J. S. that I ardently wished for an explanation. An opportunity
soon occurred. On Friday morning I received your letter informing
me of the conviction of the two brothers, and conveying an earnest
request from J. S. that I should visit him as soon as possible.
I undertook the melancholy office with mingled pain and satisfaction.
I continued with them some hours that day. What past during
the solemn interview was, I trust, suited to the awful circumstances
in which they were placed, and becoming the character and situation
in which I stood. I shall only trouble you, however, with
what relates immediately to the subject of the letter, or is connected
with it. The charge of sanguinary intentions he disclaimed as most
abhorrent to his nature and repugnant to his principles, asserted
his object to prevent the effusion of blood, and assigned more fully
and more at large the motives and reasons contained in his letter.
The whole was delivered with a serious, solemn, and unembarrassed
air, such as usually accompanies truth, and must have imprest on
my mind the fullest conviction of his sincerity. There is one fact
he mentioned on this occasion, which I shall relate to you as nearly
as I can in his own words: 'To the taking away of the life of a fellow
creature where it can be prevented my nature is so abhorrent that
I was called by some of my democratic friends "the Informer":
assassination was mentioned, and I reprobated the idea with horror
and positively declared that, unless it was instantly given up, I would
myself inform against them: in consequence of my peremptory
declaration it was given up, and the lives of some persons were
preserved.'</p>

<p>On my strongly representing to him the fatal and unjustifiable
part he had taken, and the miserable condition of his country, he
made the following reply: 'Dr. Dobbin, many wished for reform
who did not think of rebellion, but you know the progress of the
human mind; where demands, just in the opinion of those who
make them, instead of concession produce further coercion, discontents
are encreased, and a man is gradually led on step by step to
lengths he would in the beginning shudder at.'</p>

<p>His behaviour with respect to his near relatives was tender and
affecting; resigned to his own fate, he expressed the strongest
desire to save, if possible, the life of his brother. When I was
parting from him at my last visit, he conjured me in visible emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
with tears in his eyes to visit his poor mother and endeavour to
console her.</p>

<p class="right">
Adieu, my dear Sir,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> most truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">William Dobbin</span>.</p>

Finglas: July 16, 1798.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The enclosure does not seem to have been sent back by
Flemyng as requested. The original of John Sheares's letter
is now before me, preserved within the decaying folds of Dr.
Dobbin's manuscript:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><em>To the Rev. Dr. Dobbin.</em>
</p>

<p>My dear Sir,&mdash;As to-morrow is appointed for the execution of
my brother and me, I shall trouble you with a few words on the
subject of the writing produced on my trial, importing to be a
proclamation. The first observation I have to make is that a considerable
part of that scrolled production was suppressed on my
trial; from what motive, or whether by accident, I will not say&mdash;certain
it is that the part which has not appeared must have in a
great measure shewn what the true motives were that caused that
writing, if it had been produced. To avoid a posthumous calumny
in addition to the many and gross misrepresentations of my principles,
moral and political, I shall state, with the most sacred regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>Truth, what my chief objects were in writing, or rather in attempting
to write, it, for it is but a wretched, patched and garbled attempt.
It was contained in a sheet of paper and in one or two pieces more,
which are not forthcoming&mdash;the sheet alone is produced. It is
written in very violent revolutionary language, because, as it in the
outset imports, after a revolution had taken place could it alone be
published&mdash;and the<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> occurrence of such an event I thought every
day more probable. The first sentence that has produced much
misrepresentation is that which mentions that some of the most
obnoxious members of the Government have already payed the
forfeit of their lives&mdash;I cannot state the words exactly. From this
it is concluded I countenanced assassination&mdash;Gracious God!&mdash;but
I shall simply answer that this sentence was merely supposititious,
and founded on that common remark, oftenest made by those who
least wished it verified, that if the people had ever recourse to force
and succeeded, there were certain persons whom they would most
probably destroy. The next most obnoxious sentence&mdash;more obnoxious
to my feelings, because calculated to misrepresent the real
sentiments of my soul&mdash;is that which recommends to give no
quarter to those who fought against their native country [unless
they should speedily join the Standard of Freedom]. With this
latter part of the sentence I found two faults, and therefore drew
my pen over it as above. The first fault was that the word
'speedily' was too vague and might encourage the sanguinary
immediately to deny quarter, which was the very thing the whole
sentence was intended to discountenance and prevent&mdash;the next
fault was that it required more than ever should be required of any
human being, namely, to fight against his opinions from fear. The
sentence was intended to prevent the horrid measure of refusing
quarter from being adopted: by appearing to acquiesce in it at
some future period, when the inhuman thirst for it should no longer
exist. But as the sentence now stands in two parts of the sheet it
would appear as if I sought to enforce the measure I most abhor.
To prevent it was, in fact, one of my leading motives for writing the
address: but I had also three others that are expressed on the
piece or pieces of paper, which made part of the writing, but which,
tho' laid all together in the same desk, have disappeared.</p>

<p>The three objects alluded to are these, the protection of property,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>preventing the indulgence of <em>revenge</em>, and the strict forbiddal of
injuring any person for religious differences.</p>

<p>I know it is said that I call on the people to take <em>vengeance</em> on
their oppressors, and enumerate some of their oppressions. But
this is the very thing that enables me to point out the difference
between <em>private revenge</em> and <em>public vengeance</em>. The former has only
a retrospective and malignant propensity, while the latter, though
animated by the recollection of the past, has ever only in view the
removal of the evil and of the possibility of occurrence. Thus the
assassin <em>revenges</em> himself; but the patriot avenges his country of
it's enemies, by overthrowing them, and depriving them of all power
again to hurt it: In the struggle some of their lives may fall, but
these were not the objects of his vengeance. In short, even the
Deity is said in this sense to be an <em>avenging</em> Being; but who deems
him <em>revengeful</em>? Adieu, my dear sir. Let me entreat you, whenever
an opportunity shall occur, that you will justify my principles on
these points. Believe me your sincere friend,</p>

<p>The Proclamation which brought John Sheares to the
scaffold (Henry had no part in it, and died, so far, innocent)
ended with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vengeance, Irishmen, vengeance on your oppressors! Remember
that thousands of your dearest friends have perished by their merciless
orders! Remember their burnings&mdash;their rackings&mdash;their
torturings&mdash;their military massacres, and their legal murders.
Remember Orr!</p></div>

<p>These declamatory words of a young barrister and amateur
tragedian, who probably had no serious design of going red-handed
into revolution, were by no means confined to <em>his</em>
mouth. In the Appendix will be found some account of
William Orr. Meanwhile, the late Henry Grattan, son of
the greater Grattan, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Remember Orr!' were words written everywhere&mdash;pronounced
everywhere. I recollect, when a child, to have read them on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>walls&mdash;to have heard them spoken by the people. Fortunately I
did not comprehend their meaning. The conduct of the Irish
Government was so reprobated, that at a public dinner in London,
given in honor of Mr. Fox's birthday, in one of the rooms where
the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Oxford, Mr. Erskine, Sir Francis
Burdett, and Horne Tooke sat, two of the toasts were,&mdash;'The
memory of Orr&mdash;basely <span class="smcap">M&mdash;D&mdash;D</span>. May the execution of Orr provide
places for the Cabinet of St. James's at the Castle!'</p></div>

<p>The fate of the Sheareses was soon forgotten, but occasionally
a pilgrim in thoughtful mood wended his way to their
last resting place. William Henry Curran sent to the 'New
Monthly Magazine,' in 1822, an account of St. Michan's crypt,
Church Street, Dublin. This vault possesses the rare virtue
of preserving human remains.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> He was struck on entering
to find that decay had been more busy with the tenement
than the tenant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In some instances the coffins had altogether disappeared; in
others the lids or sides had mouldered away, exposing the remains
within, still unsubdued by death from their original form.... I
had been told that they (the Sheares) were here, and the moment the
light of the taper fell upon the spot they occupy, I quickly recognised
them by one or two circumstances that forcibly recalled the close of
their career&mdash;the headless trunks and the remains of their coarse,
unadorned penal shells. Henry's head was lying beside his brother;
John's had not been completely detached by the blow of the executioner&mdash;one
of the ligaments of the neck still connects it with the
body. I knew nothing of these victims of ill-timed enthusiasm
except from historical report; but the companion of my visit to
their grave had been their cotemporary and friend, and he paid
their memories the tribute of some sighs, which, even at this distance
of time, it would not be prudent to heave in a less privileged place.</p></div>

<p>The late Richard Dalton Webb, when a boy, also went to
see these reliques. With a penknife he severed the ligament
mentioned by Curran, and carried away the head to his own
home, where it remained twenty years. He finally regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
having taken it, and offered it to Dr. Madden, at whose door
the gruesome relic duly arrived.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The head was finely formed [he writes], but the expression of
the face was that of the most frightful agony. The mark of very
violent injuries, done during life to the right eye, nose, and mouth,
were particularly apparent; the very indentation round the neck,
from the pressure of the rope, was visible; and there was no injury
to the cervical vertebr√¶ occasioned by any instrument.</p></div>

<p>These horrible marks were doubtless caused by the brutal
and bungling way in which the executioner had done his work.
Madden, in good taste, restored to the shrunken trunk its long-lost
head. When John Sheares, in his last letter, spoke of
'an affectionate tear shed over his dust,' he little foresaw the
grim irony by which the words of the Burial Service&mdash;'Dust
to dust, ashes to ashes'&mdash;were to be thwarted. He never
married. Roche, in his 'Essays of an Octogenarian,' says
that, happening to occupy the rooms in Dublin where John
Sheares had once lived, he discovered, in a recess, a package
of his letters, which, on finding them addressed to a lady,
he instantly burned. Rich material for romance was thus,
happily, lost.</p>

<p>John Sheares's last letter to his sister makes feeling reference
to his natural daughter Louise, then aged seven years.
Julia Sheares gave from her pinched resources what served to
educate this girl. Louise married a Mr. Coghlan, but, owing
to his loose habits, left him. John's dramatic dash descended
to his child. She became a popular actress, and was known
on the London stage as 'Miss White.' Here the gentle
histrion went through many struggles, and was pursued by
much adulation. But panting&mdash;like Goldsmith's hare&mdash;to
the spot from whence at first she flew, Louise returned to
Ireland, and died there in 1828.</p>

<p>Whilst the parchment features of the Sheareses grinned in
agonised expression, and their orphans shivered in the storms
of a cold, neglectful world,<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> John Warneford Armstrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>battened on his blood-money, and posed as a prosperous and
popular man. Lord Cork's damaging account of his antecedents
in the letter which remained near a century sealed will
be remembered. The magisterial bench hailed his adhesion;
he took a leading place on the grand jury of his county;
Burke's 'Landed Gentry' enrolled him in its ranks.</p>

<p>In 1843 the name of Captain Armstrong again came
before the public, in connection with the prosecution of his
servant, Egan, for stealing, among other effects, a gold
medal in commemoration of his discoveries in 1798. The
late F. Thorpe Porter, from whose lips I had the following
anecdote, was on the bench with Sir Nicholas FitzSimon as
police magistrate, when the latter, recognising through a glass
door the well-known figure of Armstrong approaching, said:
'Here is Sheares' Armstrong; I don't care to meet him,' and
retired into a private room. FitzSimon, as former member
for the King's County in which Armstrong lived, had been in
pleasant touch with him, and often chuckled at his quaint
conceits. Armstrong with his accustomed swagger took his
seat, uninvited, on the bench. Mr. Porter said that he had
not the honour of his acquaintance, and requested him to
withdraw. 'I always had this privilege from Major Sirr,'
replied Armstrong, unabashed; 'and I am a magistrate for
the King's County.' 'This not being the King's County,'
retorted Porter, 'I must only repeat my request. If you
continue to sit here people in court might suppose that you
were&mdash;what I should much regret&mdash;a friend of mine.'</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Redington, the Under-Secretary, informed Mr.
Porter that Armstrong had reported to the Government the
words of which he complained, but that it was decided to take
no action in the matter.</p>

<p>Soon after a case came on for hearing before the judicial
Chairman of the King's County, to whom the Clerk of the
Peace, speaking in a half-whisper, said: 'Sheares' Armstrong'
(a nickname by which he was well known) 'has some testimony
to offer which it might be well for you to hear.' This
was done, and the chairman, in summing up, said: 'I now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
come to the evidence of Mr. <em>Sheares</em> Armstrong'&mdash;and he then
proceeded to observe upon it, innocently using&mdash;over and over
again&mdash;the stigmatising nickname, to the amusement of the
audience and the agony of Armstrong. All was not <i lang="fr">couleur de
rose</i> with this prosperous person. 'The Attornies Guide,' a
local satire, published at Dublin in 1807, and written by the
Rev. Richard Frizell, rector of Ilfracombe, notices as a judgment,
a fact which can be regarded merely as a coincidence:
'Shortly after he gave his ever-memorable evidence on the
trial of these unfortunate gentlemen&mdash;the Sheareses&mdash;he was
afflicted with a fistula in the face, which rendered him as
remarkable an object as Cain is supposed to have been after
the murder of his brother.' Frizell finally exclaims (p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>):&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unhappy Sheares&mdash;an Armstrong thus caressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy infant, hanging at its mother's breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friendship pretending, revelled at thy board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While round your neck he tied the fatal cord!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Stings like these must have severely tried his patience.
His temper was of as hair-trigger a character as the pistols
which he carried for protection. Robert Maunsell, a leading
solicitor, of whom Armstrong was a client, informed me that
the captain, on one occasion, when entertained by Mrs.
Maunsell in Merrion Square, smashed, by an awkward swinging
gesture, the leg of the chair on which he sat, whereupon
his exclamation was not a gallant apology, but&mdash;'D&mdash;&mdash; n
your chairs, madam!' This, Maunsell said, was intoned
with a nasal twang&mdash;the penalty paid for the <em>lupus</em>&mdash;which
ate into his beauty fifty years before.</p>

<p>To earn 500<em>l.</em> a year Armstrong must have done something
more than merely to ensnare the Sheareses, although hitherto
he has been credited with that exploit alone. William Lawless
was Professor of Physiology at the College of Surgeons, Dublin,
a man of mark, and very highly connected. Immediately
after his interview with Armstrong at Sheares's house we find
a warrant issued for his arrest, and it was not Armstrong's
fault if he failed to meet the fate of the brothers. A timely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
hint from Surgeon-general Stewart put Lawless on the alert.
By hair-breadth escapes he eluded his pursuers, and at last
reached France, where he became a distinguished general under
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Armstrong, when stealing on the Sheareses, sought to kill
another bird with the same stone. He was clearly making
notes for the ruin of Lawless as well, and mentioned on
Sheares's trial, among other remarks alleged to have been
made by Lawless, that the trees near the Royal camp would
come handy in suspending prisoners captured by the rebel
force. Lawless had luckily escaped at this time, but at once
wrote indignantly denying that he had ever made so horrible
a suggestion. Previous to his flight he had resided in French
Street, Dublin, whither Major Sirr proceeded with a warrant
both for his arrest and that of John Sheares, who had been in
daily conference with him. While Sirr was engaged in searching
Lawless's house a knock came to the door, Sheares entered,
and Sirr at once said, 'You are my prisoner.'</p>

<p>Lawless had seen Lord Edward constantly during the
period of his concealment; but Armstrong knew nothing of
the chieftain's movements, and, of course, had no hand in his
betrayal, though some infer to the contrary from a passing
remark made by Mr. Froude.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> But he qualified for his pension
by a general vigilance and activity in support of that red
system and policy which John Sheares's proclamation brands.
Armstrong having been questioned by Curran as to three
peasants which he had taken prisoners in '98, he replied: 'We
were going up Blackmore Hill, under Sir James Duff; there
was a party of rebels there. We met three men with green
cockades. One we shot, another we hanged, and the third
we flogged and made a guide of.'<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p>The murder of a little child by a yeoman named Woolagan
excited, even in those days, a feeling of abhorrence,
and Plowden, in his 'History of Ireland,' notices Woolagan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>acquittal by the court-martial which tried him, but does not
cite the evidence. This we find in the 'Dublin Magazine'
for October 1798. There it will be seen that the murderer
threw the onus on the general orders issued by Captain
Armstrong. Phillips and Curran, who have written of that
man, do not appear to have read this trial. The crime was
proved and not denied, yet Woolagan was acquitted. But
the Viceroy, Lord Cornwallis, condemned the verdict, and disqualified
the president of the court-martial, Lord Enniskillen,
from again presiding in that capacity.</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong, though hot-tempered, was capable of
generous acts, and his redeeming points must not be ignored.
He was a bad hater, a good laugher. Affable to all, he frequently
went out of his way to be civil; and with him sweet
words had more than their proverbial value. In days when
landlordism reigned with iron sceptre, he showed indulgence
to his tenantry; but when giving leases, or using his influence
with higher lords of the soil for that end, he cunningly got
his own life inserted as a beneficial interest to the tenants.
Thus in the hot-bed of Ribbonism he gloried to the end in a
sort of charmed life. He survived until April 20, 1858, when
he died at Clara, in the King's County, after having drawn
from Dublin Castle 500<em>l.</em> a year, or about 29,464<em>l.</em> Castlereagh,
who had urged him to his work, recommended him
for a pension, and predeceased him by nearly forty years,
might have deemed this sum excessive had he lived to see it
paid.</p>

<p>Seeking to disarm prejudice and cultivate rural friendship,
Armstrong maintained cordial relations with the peasantry.
He would enter their cabins, sit with rude hosts, and converse
with their wives on various domestic points solely of interest to
themselves. We must suppose that, consistently with his later
utterance, their children attracted from him no moving manifestation
of regard. His long life had one decided advantage.
It is stated that he lived down every political enemy and contemporary,
becoming in the end downright popular. His face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
familiar from childhood even to old men, became at last endeared
to early memories, and his neighbour, Captain Fuller,
who attended his funeral, testifies to the almost incredible fact
that he saw some well-known Ribbonmen, who were present,
weep, and horny hands upraised which, in the hot blood of
youth, had dispensed 'the wild justice of revenge.'<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

witnesses were necessary in cases of treason, but in Ireland only one, assume
that this law continues in force. The law as regards two witnesses dates from
the reign of Edward III. It received strengthening touches by the 7 &amp;

Flemyng had been in the East India Company's service, but joined the United
Irishmen during leave of absence from Bengal, in which place he had known
Lord Cornwallis, its then Governor-General, but later Viceroy of Ireland.
'Flemyng,' says Dr. Ireland, 'attained popularity for having, with his own arm,
killed the largest boar seen in India, an animal which had often ripped open
horses and oxen. One night, at Dublin, the Viceroy sent for Flemyng and
surprised him by saying that all that had passed between him and the Sheares
was known to the Privy Council. The Lord Lieutenant, then placing his arm
on Flemyng's shoulder, said: "Let not another day elapse, or not all my influence
can save you from the gallows. Start for India at once; those fellows
at Ghazapore must be put down; you are just the man to do it. You will be
gazetted to your company ere you reach Bombay." Flemyng went to India,
did the work, rose, and died rich. In 1805 he again met Lord Cornwallis, on
his arrival in India charged with the re-assumption of its reins of government;
with gratitude he acknowledged the timely service he had rendered him in
1798. Death was written in the face of Lord Cornwallis as he landed at Calcutta:
India, the grave of Europeans, folded him to its embrace, and a few
weeks later the soldier-statesman was no more.'&mdash;Richard Stanley Ireland, M.D.,

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<h3><em>LORD DOWNSHIRE'S MYSTERIOUS VISITOR</em></h3>

<p class="center">(<i lang="la">Vide</i> p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>, <i lang="la">ante</i>.)</p>

<p>The following is a <em>r√©sum√©</em> of some earlier evidence which had convinced
me that the informer whose name Mr. Froude says is still
wrapped in mystery<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> could be only Samuel Turner, LL.D., barrister-at-law.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Mr. Froude says: 'His
meeting with Hoche on the Swiss frontier was known only to very
few persons. Hoche himself had not revealed it even to Tone.'</p>

<p>But Turner knew a vast deal about the arrangements with
Hoche. An intercepted letter addressed by Reinhard, the French
Minister at Hamburg, to De la Croix, and written on July 12,
1797, may be found in the 'Correspondence of Lord Castlereagh,'
and assigned by mistake to the year 1798. In this letter Reinhard
tells De la Croix that he sent Turner to General Hoche. From
Hoche<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> himself Turner most likely learned of the secret interview
between Lord Edward and the French general.</p>

<p>But what proof have we that Lord Downshire's muffled visitor
had had himself an interview with Hoche?</p>

<p>Mr. Froude at some pages distant from the part where he refers
to Lord Edward's meeting with Hoche, when recurring to Downshire's
visitor, whose identity was 'kept a secret even from the
Cabinet,' states, from knowledge acquired after reading the spy's
secret letters, 'He had actually conferred with Hoche and De la
Croix.'</p>

<p>The intercepted letter in the 'Castlereagh Papers' refers at
much length to the proceedings of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, MacNevin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>and Turner; but Turner in this letter is called <em>Furnes</em>.
The general index to that work states<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> that Furnes is an alias for
Samuel Turner; and further he is described as 'an Irish rebel.'
Had the noble editor supposed that Turner was a spy in the pay of
the Crown, this letter would doubtless have been suppressed in
common with others which Dr. Madden misses. Lord Londonderry
brought out his brother's correspondence in 1848, during
the 'Young Ireland' agitation, and was careful to let few secrets
appear.</p>

<p>'He had accompanied the Northern delegacy to Dublin,' proceeds
Mr. Froude, 'and had been present at the discussion of the propriety
of an immediate insurrection.'</p>

<p>John Hughes, of Belfast, an officer in the Society of the United
Irishmen, was arrested immediately after Turner opened communication
with Downshire, and while in gaol turned King's evidence.
From the sworn testimony of John Hughes we learn that, in
June 1797, he was summoned by Lowry and Teeling to attend a
meeting in Dublin of delegates from the different provinces of
Ireland, in order to receive a return of the strength of the United
Irishmen. Whilst he was in Dublin, in June 1797, Teeling invited
him to meet some friends at his lodgings, including Tony
McCann of Dundalk, <em>Mr.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Samuel Turner</em>, John and Patrick Byrne,
Lowry, Dr. MacNevin, and others.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> The leaders differed as to the
expediency of an immediate rising. 'He met the above mentioned
persons at several other times in Dublin, in June 1797.'<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>'The Northern delegate had been present at the discussion of
the propriety of an immediate insurrection. The cowardice or the
prudence of the Dublin faction had disgusted him,' writes Mr.
Froude.</p>

<p>The Northern leader who was disgusted with the prudence of
the Papist conspirators in Dublin must have been Turner. In the
'Castlereagh Papers' is a letter of Reinhard, the French Minister,
stating, on the authority of Turner, 'that it was of dilatoriness and
indecision several members of the Committee were accused; that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>Northern province, feeling its oppression and its strength, was impatient
to break forth.'<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>Reinhard adds, what will surprise many regarding Lord
Edward: 'Macnevin and Lord Fitzgerald are of the moderate
party. Furness [Turner] is for a speedy explosion, and it is some
imprudences into which his ardent character hurried him that
obliged him to leave the country, whereas the conduct of Macnevin
has been circumspect.'<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>Among the men whom Hughes swears he met in June 1797,
with the Northern delegates in Dublin, were <em>Turner</em>, Teeling,
MacCann, John Byrne [Union Lodge, Dundalk], Dr. Macnevin,
Colonel Plunket,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and Andrew Comyn of Galway. These men&mdash;Turner
excepted&mdash;were all Roman Catholics; so were John Keogh,
Braughall, MacCormick, and other influential Dublin leaders&mdash;whose
names do not appear. Tone was abroad. Downshire's
visitor speaks of the men he met in Dublin as 'Papists' whose
prudence and cowardice disgusted him, and he came to the
conclusion that the two parties could not amalgamate.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude, again describing Downshire's visitor, writes: 'He
had seen Talleyrand and talked with him at length on the condition
of Ireland.'</p>

<p>The 'Castlereagh Papers' contain a remarkable letter, headed
'Secret Intelligence,' and describing very fully an interview with
Talleyrand in reference to an invasion of Ireland. On the third
page of his letter the spy writes: 'Enclosure containing the
cyphers <em>I sent to the Marquis of Downshire</em>.'<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>To this letter I must again return.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude states that Downshire's visitor had discovered one
of the objects of the Papists to be a seizure of property, and had
determined to separate himself from the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Turner belonged to a family of Cromwellian settlers. This we
learn from Prendergast's 'Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>p. 417. The letter (quoted above), printed in the Castlereagh
Papers, and acknowledging to have spied for Lord Downshire,
mentions that the writer's 'most particular friends' were men
'who feared in a Revolution the loss of their property, especially
such as held their estates by grants of Oliver Cromwell.'<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Froude says that when the mysterious visitor threw back
his disguise Downshire recognised in him the son of a gentleman of
good fortune in the North of Ireland. Lord Downshire is part
proprietor of Newry, where Turner lived, and Hill Street, Newry, is
named after the Downshires, just as Turner's Hill, Newry, is called
after the Turners.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>It may be added that Jacob Turner, of Turner Hill, in the
county of Armagh, esquire, by his will, dated April 27, 1803, acquits
and discharges his son 'Samuel from a judgment debt obtained by
me against him for 1,500<em>l.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>'"The person" had been a member of the Ulster Revolutionary
Committee,' writes Mr. Froude. This Turner admittedly was.</p>

<p>'He had <em>fled</em> with others,' he tells Lord Downshire when
describing how he came to leave Ireland and settle at Hamburg.</p>

<p>James Hope, in his narrative supplied to Dr. Madden in 1846,
when noticing Turner, writes, 'He <em>fled</em> and settled in Hamburg,
where he was entrusted by the Directory with carrying on the
correspondence between the Irish and French Executives.'<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Froude says that the mysterious man was intimate with
all the United Irish refugees at Hamburg, received instructions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>from the Home Office to open a correspondence with rebel leaders,
and had the <em>entr√©e</em> to the house of Lady Edward Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>No wonder that Lord Downshire's friend should command these
exceptional facilities for spying when we know, on the authority of
James Hope, a veteran rebel of Ulster, that Samuel Turner was the
accredited agent at Hamburg of the 'United Irishmen.'<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Froude tells us that he revealed such evidence of his power
to be useful&mdash;at Hamburg&mdash;that Pitt was extremely anxious to
secure his help.</p>

<p>As Turner is shown by Hope to have been the authorised agent
of the 'United Irishmen' at Hamburg, the reason becomes clear
why Pitt was so anxious to secure a man who had access at that
place to all the secrets of his party.</p>

<p>'An arrangement was concluded,' writes Mr. Froude. 'He
continued at Hamburg, as Lady Edward's guest and most trusted
friend, saw every one who came to her house, kept watch over her
letter-bag, was admitted to close and secret conversations upon the
prospect of French interference in Ireland with Reinhard,<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> the
Minister of the Directory there, and he regularly kept Lord Downshire
informed of everything which would enable Pitt to watch the
conspiracy.'</p>

<p>The first volume of Castlereagh should here be opened. At
pp. <a href="#Page_277">277</a>-286 will be found three intercepted letters, addressed by
Reinhard at Hamburg to De la Croix, revealing minute particulars
regarding the United Irish envoys, and bearing testimony to the
zealous help rendered to the conspiracy by Turner.</p>

<p>'I showed Reinhard Lowry's letter,' quotes Mr. Froude.</p>

<p>Turner and Lowry were old allies in Ireland, and had no secrets
between them. The sworn information of John Hughes mentions
that he saw Lowry, Turner, and Teeling engaged on a committee
for conducting the defence of United Irishmen at the Antrim and
Down Assizes in February, 1797.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude tells us that the spy who hurried to London and
sought Lord Downshire was able to describe an important letter
which was on the point of going over from Barclay Teeling in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>France to Arthur O'Connor.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Great confidence must have been
reposed by Teeling in the man who could tell all this; and such
confidence could be earned only by old intimacy and association.
What proof is there that early intimacy existed in Ireland between
Barclay Teeling and Samuel Turner?</p>

<p>The correspondence of Major Sirr, the Fouch√© of Dublin, with
minor spies, is preserved in Trinity College, Dublin. These papers
contain an information in which Dr. Conlan of Dundalk denounces,
as deep in the conspiracy, Samuel Turner, Barclay Teeling, Lowry,
and Byrne. He describes some hair-breadth escapes of Barclay
Teeling, Turner, and Lowry, and how they spent one night in a barn
near Dundalk. Conlan had been a United Irishman, who finally
brought to the gibbet his cousin Hoey and Marmion<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> of Dundalk.</p>

<p>After the betrayer had hurried from Hamburg to London to sell
his secrets to Pitt, and then as suddenly disappeared, 'he wrote to
Lord Downshire,' observes Mr. Froude, 'saying that he had
returned to his old quarters, for fear he might be falling into a trap.'</p>

<p>In fact, as Mr. Froude shows, he was in mortal terror of the
assassin's knife. Conlan's sworn information, describing the
previous doings of Teeling and Turner in Ireland, mentions how
Teeling, Corcoran, and Byrne had a password for putting informers
out of the way. Whenever one was detected he was sent to some
United Irishman with the password, 'Do you know Ormond Steel?'
'But,' adds Conlan&mdash;laying 'the flattering unction to his soul'&mdash;'there
never was occasion for this.'<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Turner's treachery was of
enormous magnitude, and most momentous in its results. Once a
man of indomitable courage, conscience made him an arrant coward
in the end.</p>

<p>'I feared,' writes the betrayer to Lord Downshire, 'lest Government
might not choose to ratify our contract, and, being in their
power, would give me my choice either to come forward as evidence or
suffer martyrdom myself. Having no taste for an exit of this kind,
I set out and arrived here safe.'<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>His dread of 'Ormond Steel' is further proved by Portland's
words in reply to the Viceroy Camden, who vainly begged that he
might come over to Dublin&mdash;'he is convinced he would go to utter
destruction.'<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of Napper Tandy, Mr. Froude says of the veiled
informer that he 'had been naturally intimate with the other Irish
refugees.'<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>Tandy, in the chapter devoted to him, tells how he and three
other Irish refugees had been invited at Hamburg by 'T.' to sup,
and were betrayed. Watty Cox, a sound authority on such points,
broadly states in the 'Irish Magazine' for January 1809, p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>, that
Tandy and his comrades were 'betrayed by <span class="smcap">Turner</span>.'</p>

<p>'He had come to England to sell his knowledge to Pitt,' says
Mr. Froude.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the price paid to <em>Samuel Turner</em> is officially
reported in Dublin Castle. For centuries it had been the custom
for England to charge her Pension List on the Irish Establishment.
Irish spies and informers are generally of a low type. Reynolds&mdash;perhaps
the most important of them&mdash;could not spell, as his
letters, placed in our hands by Sir W. Cope, show. The same
remark applies to the correspondence of other informers printed by
Dr. Madden. The letters of Mr. Froude's spy are those of an
educated man, and show that he corresponded and conversed in
French. Samuel Turner was well qualified for all this and more,
having graduated in the University of Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>These are but a few of the reasons which satisfied me that the
betrayer described by Mr. Froude was <span class="smcap">Samuel Turner</span>. I arrived
at my conclusions slowly&mdash;according as certain facts, 'far between,'
presented themselves in the field of research. But the reader, if
he cares to trace the career of this man, and does not object to
meet a repetition or two, will find an array of circumstantial
evidence amounting to moral demonstration. It may be added
that documental proof finally came to crown these researches.</p>

<h3><em>GENERAL NAPPER TANDY</em></h3>

<p class="center">(See chap. viii. <i lang="la">ante</i>.)</p>

<p>The late Mr. Allingham, of Ballyshannon&mdash;father of William
Allingham the poet&mdash;in one of his last letters, dated April 25, 1866,
recalls a strange incident. 'Should you treat of the stirring period
of 1798,' he writes, 'perhaps the following little fact may be acceptable.
Some forty years ago I chanced to be on a visit at the
hospitable residence of the late N. Foster, Esq., in the Rosses;<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> he
told me of J. Napper Tandy having put in to the Rosses, in the
year 1798, with a French ship of war, the "Anacr√©on," and how he
at once hoisted an Irish flag emblazoned with the words "Erin go
Bragh." Tandy was then a general in the French service. He
had with him, for distribution, a sheaf of proclamations, addressed to
the Irish nation; they had been printed in France, and he left
several copies at Mr. Foster's. I got Miss Grace Foster to take an
exact copy of the strange document, and which now I send you.</p>

<p>'The French General Rey also had a grandiloquent proclamation
with him, beginning "The soldiers of the Great Nation have
landed on your coast, well supplied with arms and ammunition of
all kinds, with artillery worked by those who have spread terror
amongst the ranks of the best troops in Europe, headed by French
officers; they come to break your fetters, and restore you to the
blessings of liberty. James Napper Tandy is at their head; he has
sworn to lead them on to victory or die. Brave Irishmen! the
friends of liberty have left their native soil to assist you in re-conquering
[<em>sic</em>] your rights; they will brave all dangers, and glory at
the sublime idea of cementing your happiness with their blood."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>'Napper Tandy had a large number of saddles and cavalry
appointments on board the French ship of war, but he could not
procure any horses in the Rosses. So Mrs. Foster said to him, "I
fear, General, you will not be able to put the saddle on the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>horse!" N. Tandy asked Mr. Foster: "What news?" to which
Foster replied that a part of the French troops had landed at
Killala, and, after winning the battle of Castlebar, had been finally
compelled, near Longford, to capitulate to Lord Cornwallis.
Napper Tandy seemed to doubt this intelligence, and proceeded to
take forcible possession of the Rutland post-office, which was kept
by Mr. Foster's sister. He opened the newspapers, and, to his
dismay, found that all was over with the expedition. His descent
on Rutland took place September 16, 1798. Tandy, when embarking
from the Island for France, wrote an official letter, signed and
sealed, with a view to exonerate Foster from blame for not having
despatched his mail-bags. Tandy testified that, being in temporary
want of accommodation, he was obliged to put "citizen Foster
under requisition," and place sentinels around the island. He and
his officers paid for everything they took, including two pigs and a
cow. General Rey, when leaving, removed a gold ring from his
finger and presented it to Mrs. Foster, as a token of fraternity.
Tandy not only discharged every obligation, but discharged a cannon
as a farewell note. Foster was a staunch loyalist, and ere the
"Anacr√©on" was under way he despatched two expresses, one to
Letterkenny, in hopes that the Lough Swilly fleet would intercept
them. This was not so easy, for Tandy told Foster they had met
several English cruisers <i lang="fr">en route</i>, but had outsailed them all. The
"Anacr√©on" was equally successful on its return voyage, captured two
English ships near the Orkneys, after a stiff engagement, and at
last landed Tandy and his A.D.C.s in Norway.'</p>

<p>A copy of Tandy's letter, deliberately penned when leaving
Rutland, appears in the appendix to Musgrave's 'Rebellion,' and
seems not quite consistent with the statement in the Castlereagh
Papers that he got so drunk on the island he had to be carried to
the ship.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> But his grief was so poignant on finding his dearest
hopes frustrated that it would not be unnatural, in days when hard
drinking was the fashion, if the amateur French general had
recourse to <em>eau-de-vie</em>. How he was arrested on neutral territory,
contrary to the law of nations, subjected to cruel suffering, and
sentenced to death, a previous chapter tells.</p>

<p>Fuller inquiry into the career of this quondam merchant of
Dublin finds it curiously interwoven with the history of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and his fate influential in its affairs. In 1793 Holland was the
scene of disaster to the Duke of York; and his second campaign to
that country in 1799 ended in a disadvantageous capitulation.
Previously he had sent General Don into the interior of Holland to
foment among the natives an insurrection against French rule.
Don was seized as a spy and threatened with death for seeking
to corrupt an enemy which England had failed to conquer in the
field.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> He was, however, safely restored during the negotiations
of 1799, and Plowden makes the statement, as one generally believed,
that in the Helder convention there was a secret article for restoring
to liberty Tandy and Blackwell, in return for the delivery of
Don, who, by the laws of war, had incurred the penalty of death.
The Paris journals of October 1799 said that the Duke's capitulation
contains some private articles which his Royal Highness
did not wish to submit to the consideration of the coffee-houses in
London.</p>

<p>Prolonged delay attended the liberation of Tandy. Brune
bitterly complained of it in the Council of Five Hundred; and then
it was that Buonaparte branded, as an attack upon the rights of
nations and a crime against humanity, the surrender, by Hamburg
to England, of Tandy, Blackwell, Morres, and Corbet.</p>

<p>The painful details already given as regards the severity of
their imprisonment it is pleasant to relieve by some notice of the
conduct of one official who, superior in gentlemanly instinct to
others of higher rank, treated Tandy and his companions with a
courteous consideration most acceptable to men whose hearts ached
from recent persecution. This letter&mdash;unknown to Mr. Ross, the
editor of the 'Cornwallis Papers'&mdash;was addressed, we believe, to a
near kinsman of that writer.</p>

<p class="center"><em>To Mr. Ross, the King's Messenger.</em>
</p>

<p class="right">'Dublin: November 18, 1799&mdash;<em>in prison</em>.</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;We find ourselves at a loss to know how we best can
express our acknowledgments for the very polite, gentlemanly, and
philosophic manner in which you have uniformly behaved towards
us, ever since the period of our first getting under your care at
Sheerness, during our subsequent stay in London, upon the whole
of our journey through England, and until our arrival here; a
conduct the peculiar inheritance of a man of sense, education, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
honour; and which, upon all occasions in life, must leave with the
feeling mind a pleasing and everlasting impression.</p>

<p>'All that we, sir, on our parts, can offer (and request your
acceptance of as a just tribute to your merit) is our sincerest wishes
for your happiness and future welfare&mdash;and to all of our fellow-citizens
whom the casualties of the day may hereafter chance to
place in similar circumstances with us, we wish from our hearts
the superior good fortune of falling into the hands of an officer
who, knowing his duty like Mr. Ross, like him also executes it in
a manner that honours humanity&mdash;an idea, that, with us, while
drawing a comparison between such-like conduct as we now speak
of, and that which we but very recently experienced in a foreign
country, restores to its pristine, but nearly lost worth, in our minds,
the invaluable weight of social law, and of all generous and liberal-minded
converse betwixt man and man.'</p>

<p>The interest which continued to attach to Tandy's memory long
after his death, even in quarters not likely to evince sympathy, is
curiously shown in the following extract from a letter addressed in
1846 by Robert Shaw Worthington, B.L., to O'Connell, soliciting
his patronage with the Whig Government: 'My Liberal opinions
I inherit from my father, who, strange as it may appear, was Lord
Mayor of Dublin in 1795.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> <em>His</em> liberal opinions did not serve him
in those days; he was a supporter of Catholic Emancipation, and
in the year 1809, at a private dinner-party at the house of Mr.
Farrell, Blackhall Street, my father proposed the memory of Napper
Tandy.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> One of the company (the perfidious name was Fanning)
reported the circumstance next day at the Castle; my father
received a letter from the Chief Secretary (the present Duke of
Wellington) calling upon him to disprove the charge; but, being
unable to do so, he was dismissed from his office of Dublin Police
Magistrate, the salary of which was 500<em>l.</em> per annum.'<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>
<h3>'O'</h3>

<p>The letters of secret information in the 'Castlereagh Papers,'
though assumed by most readers to come from the one source, are
divided between two spies. No successful attempt has been
hitherto made to identify the writers. The result of Dr. Madden's
inquiry went no further than to show that the letters were penned,
not by spies of a low type, but by <em>gentlemen</em> of high standing.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> It
was then that I sought to draw aside their masks. 'Downshire's
friend' (Turner) was traced more easily than a correspondent of
the Home Office, London, whose initial 'O' is dropped once only
by Wickham. The spy who contrived to accompany General Tandy's
staff in the expedition to Ireland in 1798 has left us a curious
account of what passed on board the 'Anacr√©on'<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> during their brief
visit to Ireland. The perilous character of his enterprise was quite
as striking as Tandy's descent on Donegal and escape from the
English fleet. Wickham confides to Castlereagh merely the initial
letter of this spy's name.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> The written statement from 'O' is a
curious document, and one which has been more than once quoted
by historians. An old note-book of mine contains the following:&mdash;'I
have long and vainly tried to discover this man; but to Dr.
Madden it will be at least satisfactory to know that "O" can never
have taken any prominent part in the councils of the United Irishmen,
and his name, even if discovered, would not be a familiar one.
He can never have been in the Executive Directory, or on any of
the baronial committees. He mentions incidentally that he has
been but once in Ireland for eight years.'</p>

<p>Some readers fancied that the spy 'O' who accompanied Tandy
was O'Herne,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> O'Finn,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Ormby,<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> O'Mealy,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> O'Hara,<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> O'Neill,<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>O'Connor,<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> or O'Keon<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>; my own theory was that 'O' stood for
some man whose name would prove to be Orr. At p. <a href="#Page_309">309</a>, vol. i.,
of the 'Castlereagh Papers,' in a report of the French fleet preparing
to invade Ireland, a list is given of the Irish agents at Brest:
'Orr, <em>who accompanied Murphy</em>, was still at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> Did not
seem to like going.' The letter of 'O,' describing the crew on board
the 'Anacr√©on' in its expedition to Ireland, mentions
'Murphy ... and myself' (p. 407).</p>

<p>'O,' in his secret letter dated 1798, speaks of having been in
Trinity College, Dublin, nine years before. An 'Orr' graduated as
B.A. in 1789, but this proved not much. His letter shows
(pp. 406-10) that he had the confidence both of the French Directory,
and of the Irish envoys in France. Another anonymous letter of
secret information from Paris (Castlereagh, ii. 2-7) is undoubtedly
Turner's. He speaks of Orr and Murphy as together; the first as
a 'relation of him that was hanged,' and 'Murphy as having been
lately expelled Dublin College,' and both, he adds, were applying
for passports at Altona (p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>). John Murphy made a deposition<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
at Bow Street, dated November 2, 1798, in which he names <em>George
Orr</em> and himself, proceeding to the Hague, thence to Paris, and
afterwards joining Tandy's expedition, when Murphy became secretary
to the General. It is curious to find Turner<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> and Orr&mdash;each
ignorant of the treachery of the other&mdash;reporting their movements
to the Secretary of State.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>'By direction of the Duke of Portland,' writes Wickham to Lord
Castlereagh, 'I send for the information of the Lord Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>the enclosed extract from some very important communications
that have been made to his Grace by a person of the name of
O&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>In this letter, describing Tandy's descent on Ireland, the relations
between him and the French Directory are minutely detailed,
with an account of the equipment of the expedition, and studies
of the officers on board and their antecedents.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> It is not unlikely
that Orr and Murphy, especially the latter, had been at first zealous
adherents of the movement headed by Lord Edward and Tone; but
that after the death of these leaders and the consignment of the
Rebel Directory to dungeons they considered their own position as
materially changed.</p>

<p>When Buonaparte broke faith with Addis Emmet, and sent his
legions to the Pyramids of Egypt, instead of encamping them among
the Round Towers of Ireland, Orr then sought to fill his purse, and
console a baulked ambition, by extracting gold from Pitt: 'To
show how the finances of France are,' he writes regarding Tandy's
expedition, 'and how they meant to make their Irish friends pay
their expenses, three generals went out on that little expedition;
and all the money they could muster among them was about thirty
louis d'or. One of them, to my own certain knowledge, had but
five guineas in all.'<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>Again, in a subsequent letter, he writes: 'The grand object of
the French is, as they term it themselves, London. <em>Delenda</em> (sic)
<em>Carthago</em> is their particular end; once in England, they think they
would speedily indemnify themselves for all their expenses and
recruit their ruined finances.'<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>England, unlike France, could pay lavishly, and it would be
curious to know if Orr's increasing facilities for acquiring valuable
information, according as Napoleon's power grew, were acknowledged
by the '5,000<em>l.</em>, and not more than 20,000<em>l.</em> within the year,' which
Wellington in 1808 thought fair fees for the unnamed informer who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>sent secret news from France&mdash;a man who, it is added, had been
paid at this rate by Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>Orr continued long after to discharge in France the perilous
<em>r√¥le</em> of a vigilant spy, and, as such, was a small thorn in Napoleon's
side. The Pelham MSS. contain a long letter signed 'G. O.'
(33-112, folio 205), further described in a separate note as 'George
Orr,' and beginning&mdash;'I much fear that the French have outgeneraled
the British Government with respect to what is to go
forward in the West Indies.' The date would be about 1802, but it
is incorrectly placed with papers of 1807. This is the only report
from Orr preserved by Pelham. With complicated precautions of
secrecy it is addressed 'C. W. F., Esq.', and by this mysterious
official passed on to Pelham for perusal. These initials are often
met in the State Papers, both of England and Ireland; and
future inquirers have a right to know something of the man who
played no unimportant part during an eventful period of our
history. 'Cornwallis' and 'Castlereagh' furnish no note on this
point; the 'Gentleman's Magazine,' that great storehouse of facts,
knows him not. At last, in 'Three Thousand Contemporary
Public Characters,' published by Whittaker in 1825, I found the
following notice of a career which deserves more permanent
record.</p>


<h3>'<em>SIR CHARLES WILLIAM FLINT</em></h3>

<p>Was born in Scotland in 1775; and, after having finished his
studies at Edinburgh, was taken, in 1793, by Lord Grenville, into
the office of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In 1796 Lord
Grenville sent him as confidential secretary with Mr. Wickham,
then going minister to Switzerland: with that gentleman Mr. Flint
entered into a close intimacy. He was recalled in 1797, and again
employed in the Foreign Office. Next year the Alien Bill passed,
and Lord Grenville recommended Mr. Flint to the Duke of Portland,
as a fit person to put it in execution; and his Grace, who was then
Home Secretary, appointed him Superintendent of Aliens. In this
situation he was very active, and is said to have rendered essential
service to many of the Royalist emigrants.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> When Pichegru returned
from Cayenne, he confided to Mr. Flint those plans which, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>end, brought on his destruction. In 1800 the Duke of Portland
granted Mr. Flint leave of absence, and he was sent as secretary of
legation to Mr. Wickham, then envoy to the allied armies in
Germany. After witnessing the campaigns in Bavaria and Austria,
he returned to England, where he was employed until 1802, and
was then sent to the sister kingdom as Under-Secretary of State in
Ireland. He is now [1826] agent, in London, of the Irish Department.
In 1812 he received the honour of knighthood.'</p>

<p>It may be added that the Irish 'S. S. Money Book' records a
number of payments in 1803 by Flint to minor informers, including
Murphy, the colleague of George Orr. The Wellington Correspondence
makes frequent reference to Flint; but readers are left
without any information as to who this 'very clever fellow' was&mdash;to
quote the Duke's own words. (v., p. 643).</p>


<h3><em>ROBERT AND ROGER O'CONNOR</em></h3>

<p>The unscrupulosity with which spying was practised in the days
of 'the First Gentleman in Europe' is not pleasant to contemplate.
I find Robert O'Connor, nephew of Lord Longueville, betraying
his own brother!</p>

<p>Pelham writes to Brigadier-General Coote on May 27, 1797:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have received at different times very important information
from Mr. Robert O'Connor, and indeed he was the first person who
gave me information against his brother.</p>

<p>'I hear that you have excellent spies, and I expect great success
from your exertions.'</p>

<p>General Eyre Coote writes ('Pelham MSS.' July 24, 1797):&mdash;</p>

<p>'I enclose you strong information against Roger O'Connor just
received from Robert. It is very curious that one brother should
be so inveterate against the other. I, however, am of opinion that
Roger O'Connor has been the principal in all the treasonable
practices in this part of the country.'</p>

<p>Roger, of whose adventurous feats volumes might be written,
was noted more for backsliding than backbone. Pelham, in a letter
to Coote, dated Ph≈ìnix Park, July 25, 1797, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'He [Roger] declares himself to be disposed to give every information,
and to render every service to the King's Government,
in his power.'</p>

<p>No circles, however cultured, were untainted by the spy. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Madden gives a very ugly picture of Sir Jonah Barrington revealing
at Dublin Castle the seditious talk that he heard at Lady Colclough's
dinner-table, and how Grogan, Colclough, and Harvey, men of rank
and fortune, who were present, died on the gallows ere the year
expired.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Pelham's Papers afford curious glimpses of social life in
Ireland as presented by his correspondents. A priest, who resided
near Collon in the county Louth, is described as having dined at
a squire's house in the neighbourhood,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> and a paper having fallen
out of his pocket, 'curiosity tempted some of the gentlemen to read
it. A copy of it was brought to England by Mr. William Beaufort,
son of the Rev. Dr. Beaufort, rector of Collon, and Mr. Young,
his connection, furnished a copy.' The paper, in point of fact,
embodied merely secret tenets of his religious rule.</p>


<h3><em>ARTHUR O'CONNOR</em></h3>

<p>On his way to Fort George prison, in Scotland, O'Connor distributed
some curious lines, which at first passed as an exemplary effusion,
but, on being more closely scanned, they developed rebel sentiments.
O'Connor intended that the lines of the second verse should be
read after the corresponding lines in the first. The first lines of the
two verses constituted the great sentiment which O'Connor liked to
emphasise.</p>

<h3><em>LADY MOIRA AND TODD JONES</em></h3>

<p class="center">(<i lang="la">Vide</i> chap. xii. p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>.)</p>

<p>An unpublished letter, addressed to John Philpot Curran, though
anonymous, bears internal evidence to show that the writer was
Lady Moira, whose daughter, Selina, had married Lord Granard.
In those days it was not unusual to intercept and read letters at
the post-office, and to this circumstance is doubtless due the great
caution with which the noble writer describes her relations with
Todd Jones. He was then in custody, and Lady Moira's great
object was to exculpate him as well as herself, for 'C√¶sar's wife
should be above suspicion.' Enough has been already said to
indicate the spy<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> who kept his eye on Moira House and the movements
of Todd Jones.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>To John Philpot Curran, K.C.</cite>
</p>

<p class="right">'Castle Forbes: August 13, 1803.</p>

<p>'Read, reflect, and do not answer. Time will unfold <em>the intentions</em>.
But it is common prudence to watch knaves, who are playing
the fool, and who may not chance to consider that others, from
having hearkened to the precept to be, although "innocent as
doves," induced to adopt somewhat of the "wisdom of the serpent,"
will scrutinise their measures. To state the case, Mr. Todd Jones
is the son of a physician, who in the year 1752 I formed the acquaintance
of, and attendant on the family into which I entered by
marriage; he was a sensible well-informed man, and having studied
abroad his profession at the same college with Doctor Aberside, a
person known to Lord Huntingdon and me; as a friend to that
medical poet, he became an intimate acquaintance of mine; and
having for thirty years and upwards exercised his √Üsculapian skill
with such success as to have recovered me from dangerous fevers,
and also never letting a single patient die in his hands beneath my
roof, he became the intimate friend of the family, and his son
was the companion of <em>my</em> sons in his early youth, and an inmate
like to a relation till my sons went into the world, and since then
he has regarded me with a sort of filial respect and attention, and
I have shown to him the return of maternal kindness and goodwill.
However, his residence for many years past being in England an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>d
Wales, has confined our intercourse to correspondence; now and
then a letter from me in answer to many of his, which, as he excels
in letter-writing, I always received his letters as real sources of
amusement, and of information on the subject they transmitted,
which usually had reference to antiquities.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> I had not seen him
for several years when he came over a twelvemonth ago, to settle
some pecuniary affairs with Lord Downshire's executors or agents,
having sold his estates as an annuity during his life; and a sum of
money, which money was to be kept for a space of time in his lordship's
hands, lest any claim should be made on the estate. I saw
him frequently whilst he was in Dublin, which was during that
space of time that Sir Richard Musgrave and he quarrelled and
at length fought. He left Dublin before I quitted it, and came
here in the first week of last October. He wrote to me lately from
the Lake of Killarney giving me a description of the lake and its
odd traditions, mentioning his return to Dublin in a month, and
from whence he was to return to Wales. I then heard from general
report that he was arrested and in Cork jail, which I imputed to
Sir Richard Musgrave's malice.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> For as to any treasonable practices,
Jones's indolence as well as his turn of thinking and whimsical
pursuits were a conviction to me that he was neither inclined to
be, or capable of being, a conspirator. However, in the course
of last week I was informed from <em>Moira House</em> that a person,
by warrant from the Castle, had come to search <em>for a trunk in
consequence of their having received intelligence that Mr. Todd
Jones had sent off a trunk directed to me at Moira House</em>. My
servants were examined, my house and storerooms explored, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>not any such trunk had arrived nor been heard of, and orders
were left that when it did, where it was to be sent to. Some
English letters that were directed to him at my house were
conveyed to Mr. Marsden.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> They were opened to show their
contents. One was from a Mr. Maddox, who, I think, is married to
Lord Craven's sister<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> (better known by being the daughter of the
Margravine); another from a young man going to India, and not
conveying a trace of injury to him. I wrote to a person who was
employed to execute the warrant that I could not be blind to the
affront intended to be cast upon me; that, if such intimation had
been given of a trunk then sent, the person that communicated the
intelligence was able and would certainly inform by what coach it
went, and consequently they might have had it seized when Mr.
Jones was arrested. That time had now sufficiently elapsed to
have had another key made for the trunk and to place in it whatever
papers, &amp;c., <em>might be reckoned convenient</em>. That if any trunk
did come, the <em>lock</em> and the hinges should be well examined, before
credible witnesses, before it <em>went out of my house</em>; and that I neither
was awed, nor capable of being frightened, by so mean and paltry
a contrivance. Thus they had taken up McCan,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> but, I find, have
liberated him, and given out that, as he was connected with Mr.
Grattan, it was to get papers of Mr. Grattan's into their hands that
he was arrested for that purpose; now, whether this report is to
blacken the character of the famous ex-senator, or with further
views, I do not decide. In respect to the insult I have met with, it
is aimed against Lord Moira through me. It is, however, to me a
much blacker and more artful attempt against him, in which <em>high
and mighty ones</em> were blended when too many cooks spoiled the
broth. The former plot, however, has made me alert, and awakened
all my expectations respecting possible malevolence. But my
spirit, like the palm-tree, rises by the pressure of oppressive indignity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
My eyes are so weak that I fear you will not be able to decipher
this hasty scrawl. How absurdly are they acting! Lady G&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
does not know that I write this. It is not in my nature to worry
people with disagreeable humours, nor to humiliate myself by
complaints, though I like to guard against probable evils, in which
case I shall, sir, depend upon your aid if it comes to publicity.'</p>


<h3><em>JAMES TANDY AND McNALLY</em></h3>

<p>Any person who has read the secret reports furnished by McNally
to Dublin Castle must see that the source from which he drew his
more important knowledge was James Tandy, son of the arch-rebel
Napper Tandy. This information, however, may have been gathered
partly during the unguarded intimacy of friendship. Its accuracy,
not less than the promptitude and opportuneness of each disclosure,
led a very shrewd man to suspect that James Tandy was betraying
his party, and not McNally who picked his brains. In the 'Cornwallis
Papers' (iii. 85) is one of the many secret reports sent by
J. W. to Dublin Castle. He probably chuckled when penning the
following allusion to the source from which he himself mainly
derived his knowledge.</p>

<p>'Wright, the surgeon, of Great Ship Street, has had a long
conversation with J. Tandy, in which he [J. T.] urged him to send
a paper from Wright to his father, Napper; and this he did in such
a manner as has created in Wright's mind very strong doubts of his
sincerity; indeed, <em>he conceives him to be a spy</em>, and has resolved to
avoid all further conversation with him.'</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Wright, M.R.I.A., secretary to the United Irishmen,
was a long-headed man, still well remembered in Dublin; but I do
not think that James Tandy&mdash;beyond being indiscreetly open-mouthed&mdash;can
be called an informer, much less a spy.</p>

<p>James Tandy is found a state prisoner with others after the
rebellion, but this fact in itself is not enough to exculpate him; for
Turner is also found a state prisoner. During his detention he
addressed a letter to the Secretary of State, solemnly declaring that
while he loved Napper Tandy as his father, he abhorred his politics;
and he complains of an oral slander circulated by the Solicitor-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
afterwards Baron McCleland, that he 'was guilty of high
treason, and to a certainty would be hanged.' I may here remark
that the manuscript list of United Irishmen, furnished by Collins
the spy so early as 1793, includes James Tandy's name. Tandy
with thirteen others petitioned the Viceroy on July 11, 1804, in
regard to harsh treatment they had received when state prisoners,
entered into a personal correspondence with Mr. Secretary Marsden,
whom he holds responsible for it, and threatens to horsewhip him
in case he should ever be set at liberty. James Tandy&mdash;though not
his companions in durance&mdash;was liberated on bail in September
following, and he states in a public letter: 'I obtained my enlargement
on condition that I would relinquish my intention of horsewhipping
Mr. Marsden.'<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> This statement, however, which Plowden
quotes as history, must be taken <i lang="la">cum grano</i>, for Tandy in his
memorial to the Viceroy Bedford says: 'Petitioner was discharged
from prison when in a state of health which allowed no hopes for his
life&mdash;a fact which Dr. Richards can testify, as also the surgeon-general,
Mr. Stewart.'<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>The antecedents of his family earned no gratitude from
Government, and yet we find James Tandy appointed to a lucrative
post. Lord Cloncurry casually mentions him exercising his
functions as a stipendiary magistrate.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>James Tandy's arrest and imprisonment were certainly not due to
McNally, who would be the last to kill the goose which laid the
golden eggs; more than that, he tells Cooke that James Tandy was
no republican. How McNally utilised James Tandy may be seen
from his secret letters. Both are found constantly together. A
hurried despatch from McNally, dated January 31 (he rarely gives
the year) says: 'McNally and James Tandy went yesterday morning
to Mr. Grattan's at Tinnehinch, and returned in the evening.'</p>

<p>A negotiation between Arthur O'Connor and Napper Tandy in
France is detailed by McNally: 'James Tandy has consulted McN.
on the danger of such an undertaking.'<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> On September 23, 1800,
McNally writes: 'Emmet, T. assures me (and he made inquiry), is
in Paris.' On September 19, 1800, McNally writes, 'my friend,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>
passed yesterday morning with T., junior,' and he jots down a
large amount of matter as the result of the conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>'Mr. Pelham's answer to James Tandy is expected with anxiety,'
records a previous report.</p>

<p>The secret letters of Higgins to Cooke constantly point to James
Tandy. On March 7, 1798, he urges Cooke 'to watch Napper Tandy's
intercourse with his son, and through him with the rest of the
incendiaries. His son waited on a Mr. Connell with a letter this
day.' I quote this passage because of the name 'Connell' which
occurs in it. The allusion is to the subsequently celebrated Daniel
O'Connell. Higgins tells Cooke that 'Connell holds a commission
from France (a Colonel's). He was to be called to the Bar here to
please a very rich old uncle, but he is one of the most abominable
and bloodthirsty republicans I ever heard of. The place of rendezvous
is the Public Library in Eustace Street, where a private room
is devoted to the leaders of the United Irish Society.'</p>

<p>The words are given as a curiosity, and not as accurately describing
O'Connell's real sentiments, and the statement that this
ardent youth, fresh from the mint of the French College at Douai,
held a commission from France is one of the sensational myths with
which Higgins loved to garnish his reports. In 1798 Daniel was
called to the Bar to please, as Higgins correctly states, his rich
uncle, Maurice Connell of Darrinane&mdash;traditionally known as 'Old
Hunting Cap.' Higgins is also right in regarding the future Tribune
as a rebel. He had joined the United Irishmen in 1798, but
escaped in a turf-boat previous to the insurrection. It will be
remembered that Maurice Connell, as shown by the Pelham MSS.,
was the first to report the arrival of a French fleet in Bantry Bay.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, in exploring the <em>genus</em> 'spy,' that the
violently incisive language used by Higgins is never employed by
McNally. The latter gives a man a wound and leaves him there.
Higgins poignards his victims over and over again, and kicks their
dead bodies, as in the case of Lord Edward Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>The arrest of James Tandy was made in 1803, a year after the
death of Higgins, and is likely to have been prompted by Magan,
who was active (see p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a> <i lang="la">ante</i>) at that time. In closing these
notices of the Tandy family, it may perhaps be mentioned that
Napper Tandy's father took an ultra loyal part during the excitement
caused by the rising of Charles Edward in 1745. A run on
the Dublin Banks was made, and <cite>Faulkner's Journal</cite> of October 8
in that year contains a manifesto from some Dublin merchants,
including Tandy, agreeing to accept their notes as cash.</p>

<h3><em>A TARDY AMENDE TO LORD CAMDEN.&mdash;THE
FRENCH IN IRELAND</em></h3>

<p>Lord Camden, the Irish Viceroy in 1798, has been often styled
a dull man; but he seems to have had his wits about him, as will
presently appear.</p>

<p>I find, by a remarkable letter of this Lord Lieutenant, written two
months previous to General Lake's retreat from Castlebar, that he
saw the weak points of the somewhat overrated warrior who afterwards
got a peerage for beating the Mahrattas. It may be said
that the defeat at Castlebar was due to panic among the troops,
but all accounts agree that Lake and Hutchinson had been out-man≈ìuvred
by Humbert.</p>

<p>'I remain in the opinion I originally held,' writes Lord Camden
at a time anterior to the arrival of the French, 'that General Lake
is not fit for the command in these difficult times, and have written
to Pitt in the most serious and impressive manner I am able to
make him master of the actual danger of the country. It is unfortunate
that he should have lost the advantage of General Lake's
services where he was really well placed, and have brought him
to one which is above his capacity. He has no arrangement, is
easily led, and no authority.'<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>Passing reference has been made to the arrival at Killala, on
August 22, 1798, of a small French force under Humbert; and some
notice of the sequel is due. Humbert had started from Rochelle
solely on his own responsibility. General Lord Hutchinson held
Castlebar with 5,200 men; but Lake, as the senior officer, assumed
the command. Lake arrived at dark with a large reinforcement, and
next morning was surprised to see the French troops rise from a
defile hitherto regarded as impassable, General Taylor having been
previously sent forward to cut off their approach by road. Although
the French were jaded after a forced march of fifteen hours, they
advanced with much vivacity, and attacked the King's troops, who
had posted themselves on a steep hill-side with nine pieces of
cannon. 'They advanced in excellent style&mdash;with great rapidity
as sharp-shooters,' Cooke writes.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> Lake's line wavered, a retreat
was sounded, the flight of the infantry was most disorderly, and
Sir Jonah Barrington compares it to that of a mob. Lord Jocelyn's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>Light Dragoons (he was taken prisoner soon after by Humbert)
ran like so many 'Tam O'Shanters' to Tuam, a distance of forty
miles, followed by such of the French as could get horses for the
chase. All the artillery, with five pair of colours, fell into the
hands of the French. This disgraceful panic is remembered as
'The Races of Castlebar.'<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>Such conduct, unlike their position, was indefensible; for Lake's
men, different from the enemy, had been refreshed by a good night's
rest. The French had left 200 men to garrison Killala, and
Humbert's soldiers, when in action, did not exceed 800, according
to the statement of Lake's secretary.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> But it has been often said
that the French, in making so successful an attack, must have
been supported by vast numbers of native insurgents. Again
Cooke writes, on the authority of Lake's secretary, 'he saw no
peasantry.'<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Vereker, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Limerick Militia, got a
peerage for having repulsed the French at Coloony, and the
motto on his arms is simply the name of that place. Lord Carleton
records, in his autograph, on the margin of a book, some curious
facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The skirmish at Coloony,' he writes, 'began and ended in a
blunder. Vereker (who knew nothing of the rapid march of thirty-five
Irish miles which the French had made from Castlebar) supposed
he was attacking only their vanguard; and Humbert, equally
ignorant of Vereker's force, mistook the troops which attacked him
for the vanguard of a larger body, and altered his plan of marching
to Sligo, which must have surrendered at his approach. When
Lake, with his division, arrived at Coloony next morning, he found
eighteen Frenchmen, dangerously wounded, who were left behind
by their army.'</p>

<p>The strangest part of the story is that Vereker in this attack
acted on his own responsibility, and contrary to the instructions he
had received from Lake. This brief campaign was marked by a
series of wonderful misapprehensions. French accounts say that
Humbert, seeing the strength of the British line at Castlebar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>thought of retiring to Ballina, and to cover the retreat ordered
General Sarrazin to make a feigned attack, which, being mistaken
by Lake for an attempt to turn his flank, produced the panic, where
upon Sarrazin, changing his plan, and without Humbert's orders,
charged the enemy and sent them flying. But here Humbert's
triumph stopped. Meanwhile, as Lord Carleton in another note
states, 'The Hompesch Dragoons were of infinite service, being
chiefly Hungarians, and hanging close on the enemies' rear; the
(common) Irish, deceived by their dress and foreign language, took
them for the French, and came to join them in great numbers,
but were immediately cut down, and their pockets rifled by their
supposed friends.'</p>

<p>Again, as Lord Carleton notes, the French mistaking, by its
picturesque dress, a Highland regiment for guerilla troops, sought
to fraternise with them, and greatly to their cost.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly stated, and is generally believed, that
Lord Camden was recalled in order to make way for the milder
policy of Lord Cornwallis; but it is a fact now worth recording,
though somewhat late, that the appointment of Cornwallis was
directly due to Camden himself.</p>

<p>Camden continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I return to the opinion I had entertained before, that the Lord
Lieutenant ought to be a military man. The whole government
of the country is now military, and the power of the chief governor
is almost merged in that of the general commanding the troops. I
have suggested the propriety of sending over Lord Cornwallis,
whose name, with some good officers under him, will have great
weight; and I have told Pitt that which I really feel, that without
the best military assistance I conceive the country to be in the most
imminent danger, and that my services cannot be useful to the
King.'<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Froude quotes from a letter of Camden's 'The insurgents
will be annihilated.'<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> But his tone to Pelham is widely different.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Unless Great Britain pours an immense force into Ireland the
country is lost.... I cannot suffer my character and my peace of
mind to be trifled with.'<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>Pitt acted on Camden's counsel and appointed Lord Cornwallis.
Camden confides to Elliot:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If I relinquish my situation, as I do now, merely for the public
good at the risque of a false construction, it becomes doubly
necessary that I should receive some mark of confidence that it may
not be supposed I am recalled from any opinion on the part of the
ministers that I have not acted as became me.'<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>And in a letter of the same date to Pelham, Camden says he is
the servant of the public, and ready himself 'to act in Ireland, or
elsewhere, in whatever manner I might be the most usefully
employed.'</p>

<p>Camden's counsel was followed, that the Viceroy of Ireland&mdash;in
such times&mdash;ought to be a military man. Lord Cornwallis, the new
chief governor, went down to Connaught at the head of 20,000
troops, and Humbert surrendered. On September 8, 1798, after a
fortnight's progress through the country, 96 officers and 748 French
rank and file became prisoners of war; and, according to Gordon,
500 peasant auxiliaries were put to the sword. Several sympathisers,
chiefly local gentry, were hanged; including, as Lord Carleton
notes, Messrs. Blake, French, and O'Dowd. Thus ended Humbert's
quixotic enterprise; but the previous expedition to Bantry Bay, in
1796, was very formidable; and England had not had such an escape
since the Spanish Armada. In this connection Lord Carleton has
another word to say; and I do not feel warranted in omitting what
serves to explain some things hitherto a puzzle. Few believed that
Hoche's expedition of 1796 could have escaped the vigilance and
vengeance of the English fleet which had long been watching it off
Brest.</p>

<p>'Admiral Kingsmill (a most excellent naval officer), who commanded
in Cork Harbour, was one of these sceptics. He thought it
impossible so large a fleet could have escaped the vigilance of all
his cruisers. Kingsmill had no intelligence of it, and repeatedly
said, if the French fleet was in Bantry he would suffer his head
to be chopped off on his own quarter-deck. Had not the French,
when they first made the land, mistaken the Durseys for Three-Castle-Head,
by which they missed their port, and were several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
hours beating back again, they would have got so far up the bay as
to have been able to effect their purpose. It is much to be lamented
that an officer of high rank in the British navy, Keith Elphinstone
(afterwards Lord Keith), returning from India in the 'Monarch' of
74 guns, and putting by accident into Crookhaven at the very time
the two French ships and frigates were in Bantry Bay, could not be
prevailed upon to put himself at the head of the ships then in Cork
Harbour&mdash;the 'Powerful' of 74 guns, and three stout frigates&mdash;and
block up the bay till Lord Bridport's fleet could arrive. "<em>It was
not his business.</em>" He got all the stores Kingsmill could send him,
and sailed off to England. I assert this fact as positively true.&mdash;H. C.'</p>

<p>The signature of Lord Chief Justice Carleton is affixed to all the
Government proclamations of the time. His peculiar knowledge
was largely derived as a member of the Irish Privy Council, and
from his relations with Cork, of which he was a native.</p>

<p>It was not 'the Shan Van Voght' who first announced, as the
old ballad has it, that 'the French were on the sea.' The news
came from Darrynane Abbey, where the waves roll in unbroken
from Labrador. Daniel O'Connell's people have been accused of
treasonable leanings&mdash;but unfairly. Old Maurice Connell, or
O'Connell, chieftain of Darrynane, made money through 'smuggling,'
but he was no rebel. Opening that scantily explored mine&mdash;the
Pelham MSS.&mdash;I find Maurice Connell announcing to an under-strapper
of the Government, who reports it to Pelham, that a
French fleet is in Bantry Bay, and he calls it 'most melancholy
intelligence.' The letter is dated 'Darrynane, December 20, 1796.'
'I give you this early information,' writes Maurice from his mountain
crag, 'in order that every proper measure should be pursued on an
event <em>soe</em> very alarming.'<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p>This timely information had the start by two days of Mr.
Richard White's, who notoriously received his peerage in acknowledgment
of a message of similar tenor. We learn from the old
pamphlet of Edward Morgan, that 'A servant of his (White's)
brought the first despatch to General Dalrymple, in Cork, of the
arrival of the French, on the night of Thursday, December 22,
who was but four hours going forty-two miles, Irish, on a single
horse.'<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The above is culled from Lord Carleton's copy, and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>added in his autograph, 'Mr. White, for his services on this occasion,
which were very meritorious, was created Lord Bantry.'</p>

<p>Communication with London proved so slow in those days that
reward was justly due to those who sought to mend a state of
things now hard to realise. The King's messenger, when autumnal
or wintry winds prevailed, had often to wait three or four weeks
ere the boat could sail from Dublin to Holyhead; and on one
occasion in the seventeenth century Dublin Castle was three months
without letters from London.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Even on <i lang="la">terra firma</i> a snail's pace
too often marked the progress of great officials who ought to have
set a better example. Carew, when going from Dublin to London,
lost five days in accomplishing the 'run' between Holyhead and
Chester. When the winds proved propitious, and the King's
messenger was an active man, he was able to deliver in Dublin
in one week the despatch from Whitehall.</p>


<h3><em>JOHN POLLOCK</em></h3>

<p class="center">(See p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>, <i lang="la">ante</i>.)</p>

<p>John Pollock, Clerk of the Crown for Leinster, who, according
to the 'Cornwallis Papers,' 'managed' the counsel and attorney
of the United Irishmen, deserves a note, especially as he is one
of the men regarding whom the industrious editor of that work
found it impossible to ascertain particulars. His services, which,
Cooke says, 'ought to be thought of,' were rewarded in 1800 by
the Deputy Clerkship of the Pleas of the Exchequer. Gross abuse
defiled this post; but until 1816 the iniquity was not brought before
Parliament. On April 29 Mr. Leslie Foster declared that 'Mr.
Pollock drew 10,000<em>l.</em> out of the profits, and on which he ought
to pay the salaries of the other clerks; but, instead of this, he
pocketed the whole of the money, leaving them to raise the fees
upon the suitors on no other authority than their own assumptions!'
In 1803 Pollock's emoluments from this office did not exceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
3,000<em>l.</em> a year. Mr. Attorney-General Saurin impeached him in
nine distinct charges, and as a result he was deposed.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>Pollock's name constantly appears in that curious manuscript
known as the 'S.S. Money Book,' one of the last payments to him
being on January 10, 1799, for 1,137<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> The frequent payments
to 'John Pollock for J. W.' suggested to me that the gold
which he disbursed was usually for persons connected with the
law, and with this clue I am able to trace and make clear various
ciphers which Dr. Madden was unable to explain when publishing
a copy of the Secret Account just named. For instance, we find:
'1799&mdash;16 Feb. J. Pollock for J. W.&mdash;¬£150&mdash;G. M. ¬£50.' Again,
on May 3 following: 'J. Pollock for G. M. I.&mdash;¬£50.' And on June 5
and August 3, '¬£150 to G. M. I.' Who is 'G. M.' and 'G. M. I.'?</p>

<p>George McIntagart is described in 1798 as an attorney-at-law.
Benjamin P. Binns, in an autobiographical sketch, speaks
of this man as his step-father. It was George McIntagart who,
when Mayor of Drogheda in 1798, dressed up Orangemen in French
uniforms, and sent them through the country to entrap simple
peasants. He then flogged them until, they revealed whatever they
knew. The future Duke of Wellington, writing to the Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland on March 17, 1809, observes: 'Will you have
Mr. McIntagart appointed to be Collector of Drogheda?'<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>'February 24, 1798. Mr. Pollock for J. W. H.' appears on
record. Turning to the list of attorneys in that year, the name
of 'J. Wright Heatly' is found. Dr. Madden also prints, 'August
23. Major Sirr for W. A. H., ¬£68 5<em>s.</em> 0<em>d.</em>,' but offers no conjecture
as to the owner of these initials. He must be the man
described by Plowden who, after an interview with the Irish
Privy Council, was equipped at the expense of Dublin Castle
with a showy rebel uniform, including a cocked hat and feathers,
and sent on a mission to Belfast to seduce and to betray. An
orderly dragoon repaired with instructions to General Sir Charles
Ross, who commanded in Belfast, that Houlton was a confidential
agent and not to be molested. Houlton, however, having started
in a chaise and four, arrived at Belfast in advance of the orderly,
and the result was that, when in the act of declaiming treason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>at a tavern, he was arrested by the local authorities, paraded
in his uniform round the town, and sent back a prisoner to
Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> The Belfast papers of the day give his name as
William Ainslie Houlton, and he is clearly identical with the
W. A. H. of Mr. Cooke's cipher. It would be endless to pursue
this subject. Meanwhile, those who care to follow the various
ciphers in the 'S.S. Money Book,' and to know the circumstances
under which each item is penned, can obtain full information from
the present writer.</p>

<p>Pollock in his new sinecure did not cease to gratify the
instincts which made him so efficient in 1798. A letter from him
is found in the 'Wellington Correspondence,' dated January 12,
1809, directing attention to McNevin's 'Pieces of Irish History,'
then recently published in New York. Pollock assures the future
subjugator of Napoleon that, from information he received, this
book is the precursor of a French invasion of Ireland. '<em>If you
have Cox</em>,'<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> he adds '(who keeps a small bookshop in Anglesea
Street), he can let you into the whole object of sending this book
to Ireland at this time; and further, if you have not Cox, believe
me that no sum of money at all within reason would be misapplied
in riveting him to the Government. I have spoken of this man
before to Sir Edward Littlehales and to Sir Charles Saxton. He
is the most able, and, if not secured, by far the most formidable
man that I know of in Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> This letter, from the niche assigned
to it in the 'Wellington Correspondence,' calls for a distinct
notice of Cox, whose name occurs so frequently in the foregoing
sheets.</p>


<h3><em>WALTER COX</em><a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></h3>

<p class="center">(See p. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>, <i lang="la">ante</i>.)</p>

<p>Mr. O'Donoghue, in 'Irish Humourists,' states of Cox and his
rebel sheet, the 'Union Star,' which openly urged assassination:
'While the moderate organs of the United Irishmen&mdash;the 'Press'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>and the 'Northern Star'&mdash;were being suppressed and their editors
persecuted and imprisoned, Watty Cox and his sheet were left
severely alone.' I am sure the author will allow me, in the interests
of history, to set this point right. The Pelham MSS. contain
the following letter from Cooke:&mdash;'This day I suppressed the
"Union Star." Cox offered [Justice] Bell to disclose the author,
and to tell what he knew to Government on condition of pardon.
I accepted the terms and have seen him. He was sole author,
printer, and publisher. He composed the "Star" at different printing
houses with types of different printers and struck them off by a
small bellows press of his own. He says he continued the publication
more from vanity than mischief; says that he has been for
some time against continuing the scheme of separation from
England because he thought it could not succeed ... thinks it
will if there be any invasion. Lord Edward F. [<em>sic</em>] and O'Connor
have been often with him; they knew of his writing the "Star."
Cox pronounced Lord Edward "weak but very zealous"; O'Connor
has abilities and is an enthusiast, but he thinks they want system.'
Much more follows, and Cooke adds, 'he [Cox] is a clever man and
deep.'<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p>The viceroy, Camden, writing two days later, says: 'He [Cox]
seems able to give much important information;'<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> but Camden
assumes this merely on the strength of the fact mentioned in Cooke's
letter, and Cox does not seem to have compromised his friends by
any actual disclosure. Arthur O'Connor, addressing Dr. Madden in
1842, declared that Cox remained always faithful to him, and also
to Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Whatever changes may have taken
place in his conduct, it was not until after Lord Edward's death
and O'Connor's exile. While there was a chance of success, he
was one of the staunchest men in Ireland to their cause. Had
O'Connor&mdash;a person of great vanity&mdash;dreamt that Cox called him
an enthusiast, and Lord Edward weak, his praise might perhaps
have been modified.</p>

<p>In 1803, when Dublin Castle was dismayed by the outbreak of
Emmet's rebellion within shadow of its walls, I find addressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>to Cox the copy of a letter from Under-Secretary Marsden requesting
him to call upon him, and 'nobody would be the wiser.'
Cox replies in writing to the effect that he did not care how public
their communications should be; and certainly at this time he
cannot be called 'a spy,' if indeed he ever was.</p>

<p>The Viceroy Hardwicke wrote, soon after, an official vindication
of his conduct; and he mentions incidentally that it had been
meditated to place Cox under arrest as a dangerous democrat. His
'Irish Magazine' is a marvellous medley, and contains, intermingled
with some rubbish, a good deal of valuable matter useful for future
reference. Having been put in the pillory more than once for his
writings, and finally been sentenced to pay a fine of 300<em>l.</em>, and
enter into security himself for one thousand, with two others of
500<em>l.</em> each, to keep in good behaviour for seven years, as well as
suffer one year's confinement in Newgate, Cox at last consented,
on receiving a pension of 100<em>l.</em> a year, to expatriate himself to
America. This Lord Mulgrave stopped in 1835, and the death of
Cox occurred soon after.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>


<h3>'<em>REMEMBER ORR!</em>'</h3>

<p class="center">(See chap. xxi.)</p>

<p>Documents previously quoted make ambiguous reference to the
fate of William Orr. This unfortunate person was arraigned at
Carrickfergus in September 1797, for having administered to a
soldier named Wheatley the United Irishman's oath. He was found
guilty on evidence so glaringly bad that Baron Yelverton, in sentencing
him, sobbed. Most of the inhabitants left the town to
mark their horror of the sacrifice. Newspapers of the last century
did not deal much in sensational headings. The <cite>Courier</cite>, an
influential London journal, of December 25, 1797, affords some
exception:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Murder Most Foul!&mdash;The Irish papers which arrived this
morning contain the affidavits of the Rev. George Macartney, D.L.,
magistrate for the county Antrim; the Rev. James Elder, Dissenting
Minister; and of Alexander Montgomery, Esq., stating
that Hugh Wheatley&mdash;one of the witnesses brought forward by th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>e
Crown against Mr. Orr, lately executed in Ireland&mdash;had confessed
that he had been guilty of <em>perjury</em> and <em>murder</em>!!'</p>

<p>Some of the jury also came forward and admitted that they were
drunk when they gave their verdict. These facts, duly deposed to
and attested, were laid before the Viceroy, Lord Camden, by the
magistrate who had caused Orr to be arrested, 'and who,' writes
Dr. Madden, 'when he found the practices that had been resorted
to, used every effort, though fruitlessly, to move Lord Camden to
save the prisoner. Orr was executed because of his known connection
with the United Irish system, but not on account of the crime
legally laid to his charge.'</p>

<p>The date of Lord Camden's fatal decision, in reply to the influential
appeal which had reached him, merits attention. Turner, on
October 8, 1797, disclosed to Downshire&mdash;for the private information
of the Government&mdash;a list of men, including 'two Orrs,' who, he said,
were members of the Executive Directory of the United Irishmen;
and Camden, probably, thought that Orr, who then lay in jail,
adjudged guilty of having administered the rebel oath, was one of
them. On October 13, Camden surprised Great Britain quite as
much as Ireland, by deciding that William Orr should hang, and
within forty-eight hours he suffered death.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> A painful sensation
passed through the country: Drennan's fine lyric, 'The Wake of
William Orr,' will live as long as 'The Burial of Sir John Moore.'
'<em>Remember Orr</em>' were the last words in the manuscript which
hanged Sheares. The fate of Orr had more effect in hurrying
rebellion to a premature explosion than all the efforts of Tone,
McNevin, and O'Connor. The latter urged that Ireland should
strike without further waiting for French aid.</p>

<p>Dr. Madden re-awakened interest in this case of Orr by claiming
to show that Wheatley, by whose tainted testimony he died, was
identical with a subsequently well-known military officer. Hugh
Wheatley, the informer and common soldier (Dr. Madden holds),
is the same man who afterwards figured as Captain Wheatley in the
West Middlesex Regiment, who served in Egypt, 'wore the Sphinx
on his cap,' and in 1827 resided at Uxbridge.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> In 1844 Dr.
Madden addressed to a brother officer of this man&mdash;a Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>Hester&mdash;various queries, all of which drew forth answers disparaging
to Captain Wheatley, including the fact that he was
remarkable for his love of money and his profligacy. 'How did he
get his commission?' asked Dr. Madden: 'I cannot say,' replied
Hester, 'nor could any of the officers. The commanding officers
appeared always in fear of him. It was not because he had good
pistols, for he never used them himself, but he would lend them&mdash;as
he would his cash&mdash;on interest.'</p>

<p>It seems almost a pity to spoil the piquancy of an attractive
page, but 'truth is stranger than fiction,' and as Dr. Madden
declares more than once that justice to the dead and historic
accuracy are his objects, it is right to show that in this case he has
confounded two utterly different men. Even a son of the wronged
officer is brought on the <em>tapis</em> as a person Dr. Madden had known
in another land. The following letter confirming my doubts will
help to distinguish between the two Wheatleys:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">'War Office: September 6, 1866.</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;I am directed by the Secretary of State for War to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, asking for
particulars of the service &amp;c. of a Mr. Hugh Wheatly in the West
Middlesex Militia, between the years 1799 and 1810, and to acquaint
you that he regrets that he is unable to give you the information
you wish for.</p>

<p>'I may add that a Mr. W. Wheatley was appointed to the
Regiment as Lieutenant on the 21st February, 1804, and was
promoted to a Company, 17th December, 1811.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>'A Mr. Hugh Wheatly was serving in the Tenth (Edinburghshire)
Militia in 1800 as Lieutenant. His commission was dated 26th
March, 1798.</p>

<p class="right">
'I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,<br />
'<span class="smcap">L. Shadwell</span>, Col.</p>
<p>
'W. J. Fitzpatrick, Esq., J.P.'<br />
</p></div>

<p>The Hugh Wheatley who&mdash;as we are informed by the War
Office&mdash;received a commission in the Edinburghshire Militia on
March 26, 1798, is certainly Orr's Wheatley. One of the depositions
of the Rev. George Macartney&mdash;a magistrate and D.L. for
Antrim&mdash;speaks of Hugh Wheatly as a <em>Scotch</em> soldier, who confessed
he had been instigated to give false evidence against Orr. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
after he had received his commission we find Wheatley in receipt
of Secret Service money; and on February 5, 1800, 115<em>l.</em> 2<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em>&mdash;or
one hundred guineas old currency&mdash;appears on record to his
credit.</p>

<p>Notes of a conversation with the late Dr. Verdon&mdash;a representative
of William Orr&mdash;discloses some things new to students of the
time. Major Orr, son of William Orr, served with distinction in
the Peninsular War; he obtained his commission at the age of
twenty-three, and on his return to England the Duke of York, then
Commander-in-Chief, after complimenting him upon his services,
asked if there was any promotion he ambitioned. 'I hate the
sword I wear,' was Orr's sullen reply; 'perhaps your Royal
Highness will allow me to retire from the service.' 'Pray are you
related to Orr who suffered in '98?' inquired the Duke. 'I have
the honour to be his son,' the soldier replied. The Duke with
reluctance accepted the resignation, and next day wrote a cheque
for 1,000<em>l.</em>, and sent it to the widow of William Orr 'as some slight
compensation for the loss she had sustained' twenty years before.
The Duke of York was at this time heir apparent to the throne.
Captain Orr retired on full pay with the rank of brevet major.
Some years after, finding that his means were inadequate to meet
domestic expenses, he asked the Duke for a barrack mastership.
Orr filled this office in Longford, and subsequently in Dublin till
his death.</p>


<h3>'<em>THE WEARING OF THE GREEN</em>'</h3>

<p>Mrs. Anastasia O'Byrne, who died in 1875, had been in the
habit of sending me rough recollections of such small things
as came within the cognisance of a very unobtrusive woman.
Some of her letters appeared in a former book. The following is
new:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'In May, 1798,' says Mrs. O'Byrne, 'the narrator, then a comely
matron of thirty, possessing a soft innocent expression and a delicate
rose-hue complexion, donned her bonnet of the previous season,
with intent to make some purchases in the drapery line at a
flourishing mart in Thomas Street. The bonnet was of bright green
silk, had often been worn without remark, was purchased for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
its supposed becoming effect, and had lain quietly ensconced in its
bandbox throughout the winter. But during that eventful season
the political atmosphere had undergone disturbance, and the storm
which shattered to pieces many happy homesteads was about to
sweep through Ireland. Amid other signs of the times, "the
wearing of the green" came to be regarded with suspicion and
dislike by the authorities of the day. Of this, however, the wearer
of the green bonnet was then quite unconscious. On she went,
but was rather concerned, and somewhat puzzled, to find herself
attracting an unusual share of the attention of the passers-by, particularly
as she was alone. As she passed out of Dame Street into
Castle Street and Skinner's Row,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> where the narrowness of the flag-way
made collisions of passengers a rule rather than an exception,
she was startled to hear, every other moment, a voice whispering,
almost under her bonnet: "God bless your colour, ma'am!" She
remarked that those who did not use this phrase regarded her with
an angry scowl; but still no thought of connecting these incidents
with the <em>hue</em> of her bonnet ever crossed her mind. On her return
from Thomas Street her attractive power seemed to increase, the
cabalistic words: "God bless your colour, ma'am!" were not uttered
so frequently, but the streets were greatly crowded by men, some
of whom regarded her bonnet with so fierce a glare that she
thought they had a notion of plucking it from her head. She then
began to perceive, with some alarm, that scarcely any women
were abroad, and that military and yeomanry paraded the streets.
When she reached Cork Hill she saw masses of people thronging
the line of way in Dame Street, whilst the crowd about the Castle
gates and the Royal Exchange seemed heaving in agitation
like the waves of a troubled sea. Whilst trying to pierce the
dense crowd around the Royal Exchange she heard a familiar
voice shout her name twice in a loud, excited tone. She glanced
in the direction of the sound, and saw the pale, eager face of a
young man of her acquaintance, the husband and brother of two
intimate female friends, peering at her through one of the windows
of the Royal Exchange, then a receptacle for State prisoners.
Entering a little by-street she turned with great difficulty from
the surge of the crowd which was floating from College Green side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>and soon got into more quiet quarters. By the circuitous route
she reached home unmolested, but found the household in great
alarm about her, for tidings had reached them that several females
during the tumult of the day had been rudely insulted, and roughly
treated, for wearing ribbons or garments of green hue, one most
respectable lady having had a gown of the obnoxious colour sliced
from her body by the sabre of a loyal trooper. The excitement of
the day was caused by the arrest of the unfortunate brothers Sheares.
The young prisoner who called on her from the window had just
recently been arrested in the street on suspicion, solely on account
of having used indignant words of remark in the hearing of a loyal
yeoman. His great anxiety to gain the notice of the wearer of the
green bonnet was caused by his desire that his relatives, who were
ignorant of his arrest, should learn it, and take measures for his
release, before the tidings of it could reach the ears of a very youthful
wife in a very delicate condition.</p>

<p>'The poor fellow was speedily released, for higher game had
been bagged, and nothing beyond his warm words could be adduced
against him. But the young wife, whom he soon after left a widow,
always believed that his early death was caused by his arrest. He
had caught a severe cold whilst in prison, his lungs became affected,
and rapid decline and early death ensued.</p>

<p>'On the day of the arrest of the Sheareses the wearer of the green
bonnet beheld the sacking and the attempted burning of the house
and stock-in-trade of Patrick Byrne, the bookseller of Grafton Street
in whose shop the brothers were first introduced to their betrayer,
Captain Armstrong. It was a pitiful sight to behold the amount
of property in beautifully bound books ruthlessly torn to pieces and
tossed out of windows into the street. Byrne was arrested, but
afterwards got safely out of the country, and settled in Philadelphia.
His brother, a Roman Catholic priest in Rosemary Lane Chapel,
followed him to America.'</p></div>

<p>The old lady's garrulousness about her green bonnet has been
allowed space the more readily because the following contemporary
statement comes to illustrate and explain, not only her own reminiscence,
but an oft-quoted phrase which has become historic. I
have culled it from the London <cite>Courier</cite> of August 29, 1797. The
<cite>Dublin Journal</cite> to which it refers was the organ of the Irish
Government, and the property of Jack Giffard:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ireland.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite>Dublin, August 24.</cite>&mdash;The <cite>Dublin Journal</cite>, with base malignity,
throws out the most indecent insinuations against the virtue
of every female who wears <em>green</em> in her apparel. How the citizens
of Dublin, and the inhabitants of the country, who are also included
in this infamous denunciation, will bear to have their wives and
daughters so stigmatised, remains to be seen. A more villainous
libel never disgraced the Press. In case of success, it must render
useless all the goods in silk, cotton, or woollen which have been
dyed green, to the ruin of the manufacturers. Language is not
adequate to express the abhorrence that arises at this hellish meditation
to rob women of their character and working-people of
bread!</p></div>

<p>A corps, called the 'Antient Britons,' attained by their cruelties
notoriety in '98. Pelham, in a secret letter, recognises their activity
and loyalty; but casually adds (a trait which, coming from him,
will be more regarded than if told by a partisan): 'They were
quartered at Newry,' he writes, 'where there was a lady as active
as the Miss Greggs at Belfast, and upon her accosting a soldier on
guard, she was certainly very roughly treated.... They tied her
petticoats round her neck, and sent her home showing her garters.'<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>
Pelham probably learned this fact from one of the letters of Samuel
Turner, formerly of Newry.</p>


<h3><em>FATHER O'LEARY</em></h3>

<p class="center">(See chap. xvi. p. <a href="#Page_236">236</a>.)</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">O'Leary in 1782.</span></h4>

<p>The following letter&mdash;one honourable to O'Leary&mdash;has escaped
the vigilance of all his biographers. It seems to have been addressed
to Mr. Kirwan, a Catholic leader who held some military rank in
the Volunteer army, and who at mess had been asked to drink
'The glorious, pious, and immortal memory' of William III.!
'<i lang="la">Jungamus dexteras</i>' was the motto of O'Leary and Grattan at this
time. The former, in his reply to the Bishop of Cloyne in 1796,
states that the policy of Dublin Castle was '<i lang="la">Divide et impera</i>.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>
<p>This letter is dated a year previous to Lord Sydney's effort to corrupt
O'Leary. From that hour no such courageousness of demand
marked his utterances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">'Cork: October 4, 1782.</p>

<p>'Much esteemed and dear Sir,&mdash;I am honoured this instant with
your kind favour, which makes me doubly happy, in the information
that you are well, and the satisfaction of still retaining a
share in your remembrance. Your choice of Lord Mornington<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> for
your Colonel gave me infinite satisfaction, and your design to
continue him at your head until he forfeits his claim to that honour
by some unbecoming and well-attested steps is equally founded in
wisdom and justice. Let it be the province of bigots to censure the
toast, after the reasons alleged for having given it. King William
was the first who scattered the seeds of liberty in this kingdom.
There is nothing in the frame of a Catholic that is averse to its
growth. He never violated his engagements with the Catholics of
Ireland, though often solicited to a breach of promise. There was
not a Stuart, from the first to the last, but betrayed them, either
from cowardice or treachery. James II. promised to repeal his
Declaration, on condition of being reinstated. What could freedom
expect from the resumption of his dignity?</p>

<p>'In the very heat of action, when the alternative was death or
victory, he commands <em>to spare his English subjects</em>.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> <em>Poor man!
he was tender-hearted and pusillanimous!</em> I care not. Bears are
fierce, and deer are timid. It is equal to me whether I suffer by
the claws of the one or the horns of the other. In my opinion,
though our sufferings have been long and unmerited, it is happy for
us that King William came over; for under weak kings of our own
religion, controlled by laws, we would be for ever obnoxious to our
fellow-subjects. Every gentleman from Dublin whom I meet here
talks with admiration of the Irish Brigade.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Sir Boyle Roche, who
wrote me a letter the other day, talks of them in a strain of rapture.
I never have seen an address from the Catholics of Ireland but I
spurned with indignation at, except your late address to Earl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>Temple. They were always couched in the cringing language of
servility, and even falsehood, boasting of <em>common blessings</em>, when it
was in the power of your children to strip you of your kitchen-gardens
and the shoeboy of your houses. In your last address you
spoke as Gentlemen, thankful for what you got, and decently
intimating that you want and deserve more. I make it my humble
request that, whilst one Penal Law stands upon record, except
those that exclude you from the Senate and high offices under the
Crown, in every address you will glance at your restraints. Were
it not from an apprehension of incurring the displeasure of the
Catholic Gentlemen of Dublin, I would have torn Gormanston's<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
address, and Portland's answer, to pieces. The former addressed
as a contented slave, and the latter answered with the rudeness of
a Batavian burgomaster who would say "<em>Behave always so, or
else &mdash;&mdash;!</em>" The liberal-minded Protestants themselves acknowledge
that enough has not been done for us. It is what Lord Beauchamp
wrote to me when I was in Dublin. I send you Mr. Hamilton's
letter on the same subject. I received it here, in a letter from Sir
Boyle, who applauds <cite>the wisdom of the Irish Brigade in not adopting
the violent measures of several armed societies</cite>. There is some
meaning in these words, which I here would not have communicated
but to a few of the discreet of our own. You can keep Mr.
Hamilton's letter until I pay you my respects in Dublin. I wish I
knew who he is.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> As to the Dungannonists,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> they should be
remembered with gratitude by the Catholics of this kingdom. But
as the Brigade is composed of all parties without distinction but
such as merit confers, whether a letter which would give them the
appearance of a Roman Catholic armed society would be expedient,
however merited, you are the more competent judge. Whether the
sycophants of Government, averse to the Northerns, would not
represent Peter leaguing with John against Martin, who once confined
them to a boxing-match over a tub, but sees them now shake
hands over the table when they can appear with their swords and
bucklers in the hall. However, should you deem the measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>eligible, considering time, place, circumstances, the sympathies of
some, the antipathies of others, the clashing of interests, the
factions of parties, the jealousy of Government wishing the metamorphosis
of your shining blades into shepherd's crooks,&mdash;there is
not one living who would sooner comply with my friend's request
than I would. But from conviction, free from flattery, I affirm that
he is better qualified for a similar letter. I heard of him before I
knew him; known, I conversed with him. I guessed what he could
do. I read the sentimental and correct Las Casas. I was convinced
that I had not guessed in vain. From this motive I cannot be prevailed
on, besides the time, which has grown so scanty on my hands
since my arrival here that I cannot spare one hour; exhorting every
Sunday, and attending to several avocations, which, though of some
benefit to others, often make me regret that I ever quitted my solitude
and books. I suggested once to Mr. Weldon to propose Dr. Dunn&mdash;a
Dissenting minister&mdash;to the Brigade for a third chaplain. If he
be proposed and elected about the beginning of March, or any time
after, I shall write him a letter, in which I shall pay those of his
profession the compliment they deserve without giving offence to
others. Ever &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Arthur O'Leary</span>.</p>

<p>'My best regards to Mrs. Kirwan, Messieurs Braughill, Ryan,
Gavan, without forgetting our worthy Brigadier Sutton.'<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p></div>

<p>The biographer of Grattan cannot be regarded as an authority
when speaking of O'Leary. A letter headed 'Dr. O'Leary to Mr.
Grattan,' appears in Grattan's 'Life,' vol. v. pp. <a href="#Page_263">263</a>-4. It is dated
May 25, 1805; begins, 'My dear Grattan;' speaks of his (O'Leary's)
little grandson, and ends, 'Believe me, with truth and affection,
your sincere friend and faithful confessor, Father O'Leary.' 'I
congratulate you, myself and my country on the honour your
speech on the Catholic question has conferred on us,' he writes, and
thanks Grattan in extravagant terms for having introduced his
name with laudation.</p>

<p>Grattan's speech&mdash;delivered on May 13, 1805&mdash;occupies from
page 914 to 940 of 'Hansard,' and O'Leary is not once named in it.
Grattan's biographer inserts with all the prominence and respect
due to a genuine document this transparent hoax. He adds a foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>-note
to say that Grattan's speech in May, 1805, praised O'Leary.
The biographer ought to have known that O'Leary had been three
years dead in 1805, and that it is not usual for friars to rejoice in
grandsons.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Old St. Pancras.</span></h4>

<p>Father Arthur O'Leary died in London on January 8, 1802.
The remains lay in state; a grand dirge was sung; an imposing
funeral cort√®ge followed them to Old St. Pancras, where a fine
monument to his memory, inscribed with words of praise, soon
marked the spot. Tradition states that Old St. Pancras was the
last church in London where Mass was said after the Reformation:
hence the wish felt by Catholics in penal days to sleep within its
precincts. A visit to this historic graveyard in its present
desecrated state awakens emotion. No ground, however, is sacred
to the engineer. Old St. Pancras is now traversed by two lines of
railway&mdash;more regard being paid to the 'sleepers' above than to
the sleepers below. Passing trains ever and anon cause this resting-place
of the dead to tremble violently as if by earthquake.
Indeed a seismic shock, had it passed through the churchyard,
could hardly have produced more wreck. Here many an old tombstone
inscribed '<em>Requiescat in pace</em>'&mdash;others displaying grand
heraldic sculpture&mdash;even a bishop's mitre and a shattered coronet&mdash;proclaim
the irony of fate. The scorched and begrimed soil, once
green and rural, but now split into a hundred fissures&mdash;almost
tends to remind one of a great Scriptural picture, where shrouded
dead are seen rising in protest from the riven earth. Tablets and
tombs sufficient to represent the life of a city are rudely removed
and ranged far from the graves they ought to mark. 'Old Mortality'
will find them piled&mdash;close as cards in a pack&mdash;beneath a dark
archway, over which locomotives rush, their shrill scream suggesting
a cruel travesty of the last trumpet. A few massive mausoleums
are certainly spared, and amongst them that to the memory of
O'Leary. Another part of the disused cemetery creates quite a
contrast to the scene of desolation just described. Parterres smiling
with flowers may be seen; also winding walks, and an occasional
shaded seat, where whispering love repeats a story older even than
Old St. Pancras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>PRIESTS AS SECRET AGENTS</em></h3>

<p>Dr. Hussey was not the last Catholic priest sent by the Court of
England on a private mission to the Continent. The subsequent
Duke of Wellington, writing from London to Dublin Castle on
March 18, 1808, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It would be very desirable to have a person to send over to
Holland and France just at the present moment, and I know
nobody that would answer our purpose so well as &mdash;&mdash;, the
Scotch priest. I wish, therefore, that you would desire him to
come over to me.'</p>

<p>On the following day he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>'As I intend to send &mdash;&mdash; to Paris, it might not be inconvenient
to know the person through whom the disaffected communicate with
the French Government in order that &mdash;&mdash; might watch him.'<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>The chief blank may be filled with the name of the Rev. James
Robertson. The nephew of this man, Mr. A. B. Fraser, found
among his papers, 'A Narrative of a Secret Mission to the Danish
Island in 1808.' The priest had been sent by Wellington to the
Spanish general Romana, and the result was the transmission of
the Spanish army from the service of France, by the British fleet,
from North Germany to Spain.</p>

<p>Spain was the theatre of a still more important case of secret
service rendered by a Catholic priest. In 1860 I wrote to Field-Marshal
Lord Combermere as the only man then living likely to
know of the relations which subsisted, during the Peninsular War,
between Wellington and Dr. Curtis, Rector of the Irish College of
Salamanca. The following is a portion of his reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Dr. Curtis had been fifty years head of the College when he left
Spain to become Roman Catholic Primate of Ireland.</p>

<p>'He had communicated very valuable information to the Duke
of Wellington while Soult held his headquarters at Salamanca.</p>

<p>'His connection with the Duke was suspected before the first
entry of the British into Salamanca, and two days previous to this
event, while dining with Soult, Dr. C. heard the General remark
how strange it was that Lord Wellington seemed so well acquainted
with his proceedings.</p>

<p>'Some of the aides-de-camp looked at Dr. Curtis pointedly on
this occasion, and the next day, while at table with the same party,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>similar observations were made, and Dr. Curtis perceived that the
suspicions of Soult had been in some manner confirmed.</p>

<p>'On his return home that night, he found two gendarmes
awaiting him, and he was at once conveyed to prison.</p>

<p>'He assured Lord Combermere that had not the English
arrived the next day, he would have been executed as a spy.'</p></div>

<p>It may be added that the mysterious reference in Wellington's
despatch of May 8, 1811,<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> is to Dr. Curtis.</p>

<p>The appointment of this priest by the Pope as 'Archbishop of
Armagh, and Primate of All Ireland' was directly due to influence
exerted with Cardinal Gonsalvi by British statesmen, including
Lord Castlereagh, Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Duke of
Wellington maintained for many years a constant and cordial correspondence
with the Primate, and the Duke's change of policy on
the Catholic Question was not uninfluenced by it. The papers of
this eminent prelate, varied and voluminous in their character,
have been long in the custody of the present writer, and at a future
day may be dealt with as their importance demands.</p>

describing himself and his parentage. Anxious to ascertain whether the description
of Lord Downshire's friend would apply to Turner, as the son of a gentleman
of property in Ulster, I applied at the King's Inns, Dublin, to be allowed
to see how Turner described himself&mdash;but was refused, although the object
was explained to be one purely historical. This greatly retarded my inquiries,
which were begun many years ago. At last an examination of the wills
and the entrance-book of Trinity College, Dublin, established all that I
had surmised, and the following letter, which I find in the Pelham MSS., is
further important in this connection:&mdash;'The arms belonging to Mr. Turner,
senior, a magistrate near Newry, were taken from him at the time of the general
search for arms in that county. I believe that his conduct has been misconceived
owing to the conduct of his son, and, if you see no particular objection
to it, I should be glad that his arms should be restored to him' (Pelham to
General Lake, Ph≈ìnix Park, August 3, 1797).</p></div>

to my purpose. Lady Moira would be the last to suspect her neighbour
Magan; and she naturally thought at once of Musgrave, who had so recently
accepted Jones's challenge. But Lady Moira was wrong in thinking that,
when their affair of honour ended, Musgrave owed spite to Jones. He afforded
good proof to the contrary in omitting from later editions of his book the
passages which had offended Jones. The duel took place at Rathgar, Musgrave
was slightly wounded, and Ned Lysaght said that his next edition would probably
be 'in boards.' Jones, in a private letter, written long after, speaks of his
antagonist as 'Dick Musgrave,' and exonerates him from the suspicion of having
spitefully caused his arrest. A notice of the duel appears in the <cite>Annual Register</cite>

</p>

<p>'Mr. Fitzpatrick's memoir is richly studded with anecdotes and sketches of
his attractive hero as politician, scholar, theologian, professor, bishop, religious
director, and friend. The biographer has a keen eye to humour, and has thrown
in a number of specimens of Irish wit. He is exclusively the master and the
specialist of his subject.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Saturday Review.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Of this distinguished man, Mr. Fitzpatrick has lately published the "Life,
Times, and Correspondence," after having accumulated ample materials for his
undertaking by unwearied personal investigation and epistolary inquiries extending
through several years. It is in every respect an original work, tracing
the intellectual progress, examining the motives and policy, and illustrating the
character and habits, of by far the ablest Roman Catholic prelate of recent times.
[Three columns of eulogy followed.] Men of all parties united in conceding
to him the praise of a high order of genius and of unsullied virtue. Indeed,
under whatever point of view the career of this eminent man is viewed, the
conclusion which the perusal of these volumes will force, even upon those least
disposed to appreciate his high qualities, must be that he was a master-spirit,
an honour to the country which gave him birth, and an ornament to the
Christianity which he so earnestly preached and so devoutly practised.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Morning Post.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Mr. Fitzpatrick, whose previous biographical works have been favourably
received, has published a "Life of Dr. Doyle" full of amusing and instructive
matter.... In closing this volume, we cannot but express our regret that so good
a man and so sincere a patriot should not have survived to our own happier
times.... A lively, gossiping, and sensible biography.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spectator.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Those who take an interest in tracing the history of past agitations will find
ample amusement in the "Life and Times of Dr. Doyle."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Westminster
Review.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'... These volumes really contain the history of Ireland for a quarter of a
century. In these days of hasty compilation and superficial literary labour, it
is refreshing to meet a work so original, so full of research, so honestly and ably
written as this "Life of Dr. Doyle." Mr. Fitzpatrick has performed a task which
secures for him a very high place among Irishmen who have enriched the historical
literature of their country.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily Express</span> (Dublin).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1002" id="Page_1002">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Our words may sound extravagant. We can only repeat the motto in Doyle's
coat of arms&mdash;"<i lang="la">Tolle lege</i>." Take up the book which narrates his life, times, and
correspondence, and read. We appeal to the monuments of history, so beautifully,
so accurately, so eloquently displayed before us by the great historian of
one of the greatest men. The book before us is a monument of Mr. Fitzpatrick's
skill, of his knowledge of men and events, of his great power of discernment,
of his faithfulness, of his impartiality, of his herculean labour, of his exalted
Christianity.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boston Pilot.</span></p>

</p>

<p>'Mr. W. J. Fitzpatrick has brought out a new and much-amended edition of
his capital contribution to our knowledge of "Ireland before the Union."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Athen√¶um.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'But we must refer the historical student, who would know something more
than the historian has yet deigned to tell us, to this remarkable production of
patriotic industry. Wonderfully clear, and vivid, and varied is the portraiture
interspersed in the illustration of the man and his times, and very often illumined
by bright flashes of wit and humour. Mr. Fitzpatrick has been called the Irish
Boswell, but he includes all the best qualities of his best editors added to
Boswell. This volume ought to have a place in every historical library.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Morning Post.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Most complete and entertaining. As anecdote follows anecdote, and revelation
after revelation is unfolded, we are lost in wonder that the perpetrators of
such outrages and acts of oppression as Mr. Fitzpatrick describes, gathered from
the most authentic sources, could have been suffered to follow out their evil
courses for even a single week.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Field.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'A true picture of Irish society towards the close of the last century, and
shows to what sort of people the highest places of the State were in that country
entrusted. The author is Mr. Fitzpatrick, who has hunted up his facts in many
quarters, and woven them into an exciting narrative.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily Telegraph.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'A clever work, filled with amusing anecdotes and interesting disclosures.
No doubt it will have a large sale, not only in Ireland, but in the United States.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cosmopolitan.</span></p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
